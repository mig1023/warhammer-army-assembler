			<Description>The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of bestial humanoid barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of the Warhammer World. The term "Greenskins" is a common collective description used by many civilised nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races. The broadest division is between the Orcs, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.\n\nThe Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilisation. These tribal warriors are extremely violent, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known world. Time and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, an ever increasing mass of warfare that has the potential to dominate and cover the entire world in a seething green tide</Description>

					<Rule>+D6 Attacks</Rule>
					<Lore>Revered subject of the Orc myth of the end of everything when Gork's (or possibly Mork's) chosen Best Boss Ragnar goes mad with an axe and destroys the whole world. This is the famous Orcish day of Ragnarork</Lore>
					<Description>In close combat the bearer receives a potentially whopping +D6 Attacks - roll randomly each combat round to see just how crazed the wielder is that particular turn. On a 6 the favour of Gork (or possibly Mork) is withdrawn from the wielder oner his attacks have been resolved - the Battleaxe of the Last Waaagh! then ceases to work at the end of that Close Combat phase</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>

					<Points>75</Points>
					<AutoWound/>
					<Lore>Even for a simple instrument of hacking Kleeva's Cleaver is a brutal looking weapon</Lore>

				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Krumpa's Club of Crumpin'</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<NoArmour/>
					<Lore>This sacred weapon has been passed down the generations for more years than an Orc can count. Handed down from Boss Orc to Bigger-Orc-that-could-take-it-off-him, this rather well worn spiky club punches through armour with no problem</Lore>
					<Description>The Club of Cnimpin' allows no armour saves</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Basha's Big Aхе of Bashin'</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Add To="Attacks">2</Add>
					<Lore>This legendary axe is all that is left of the once mighty Basha Warboss of the Iron Skullz after he stood rather too close to a drunken giant at the Battle of Grim's Crag</Lore>

				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Hacka's Sword of Hacking</Name>
					<Points>45</Points>
					<HitOn>2</HitOn>
					<Lore>It was said mostly by Hacka that he fought alongside Azhag and was the one who first proclaimed him the Slaughterer. He also mentioned single handedly killing Sigmar and being a drinking buddy of Gork (or possibly Mork). Whatever the truth Hacka acquired this slender and rather Elven looking sword from somewhere strange and nobody ever felt much like asking where. Not after the last time anyway</Lore>
					<Description>Ihe Sword of Hackin' hits on 2+ regardless of the wielder's WS</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Fumpa's Club of Fumpin'</Name>

					<Add To="Strength">2</Add>

					<Rule>If an enemy model suffers one or more wounds (after saves) inflicted it may make no more Attacks in that combat engagement</Rule>
					<Lore>The spite and lust for vengeance that ooze from this weapon leave those struck by it utterly dumbstruck and unwilling to attack lest they incur its wrath once more</Lore>
					<Description>If an enemy model suffers one or more wounds (after saves) inflicted by the Curmudgeonly Clobbera it may make no more Attacks in that combat engagement. If the victim is mounted or rides a chariot, then only the rider monster that actuallv suffers the wound is 'clobbered' and not the entire model/mount/etc. Only one model ran be 'clobbered' at a time. Other models that are hit whilst one is 'clobbered' suffer wounds as normal but no additional effects</Description>

					<Lore>Most of the many spears that have been used by Porko's Boar Boyz lie shattered on the battlefields of the Old World, but not this one. In battle the gleaming point of the Pigstikka pierces enemy armour with ease skewering several foes with one strike ready for later as Porko used to say referring to the traditional after battle barbecue</Lore>

					<Rule>+3 Attacks once in the game</Rule>
					<Lore>Duffa was Wollopa's sidekick until he was eaten by a Squig. Waking up inside the Squig's stomach was a bit of a shock and although he fought his way out he was never quite the same afterwards. It is said that this club retains some of his frenzy to escape even now</Lore>
					<Description>Duffa's Club of Duffin' strikes with +3 Attacks once in the game. The Orc player must declare that he's using the extra Attacks before he makes any rolls to hit.

On a 4+ the spell is reflected back at the caster with all the normal effects.

					<Lore>As it absorbs the force of incoming spells this small and unimposing amulet begins to glow ever more brightly. To most creatures this might be seen as a warning, but not to the Orcs who regard it as increasingly interesting. Eventually the power will be too much and it will burst immolating the bearer though the Amulet itself will be unharmed</Lore>

					<Name>Gork's WAAAGH! banner</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Add To="Movement">1</Add>
					<Lore>On the eve of battle the Greenskin shamans invoke the spirit of the great god Gork before the tribe's mighty Waaagh! banner. The banner is liberally daubed with vast quantities of Orc dung blood and spittle which will serve to absorb the battle thirst of Gork. The shamans whirl and dance insanely howling and gabbling in spirit talk all night long as the Waaagh! banner slowly grows in power. It also acquires a unique odour which is an unmistakable mark of tribal recognition</Lore>
					<Description>The unit that carries Gork's Waaagh! banner adds +1 to its Movement value (i.e. +1" on its normal move and +2" on its charge and march) so long as it moves towards the closest enemy by the shortest route</Description>

					<Name>Guff's Flag</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>May re-roll one failed Panic test during the battle</Rule>
					<Lore>The lads that fight under the proud banner of Guff do not quail in the face of defeat, nor slacken their resolve when all about them run for the hills. Or so they say anyway. Some say this is because the flatulent Guff was such a valiant fighter, others that the lingering smell of the banner simply addles the brain</Lore>

					<Rule>+1 Attack, only one use for one turn</Rule>
					<Lore>Nogg's notorious Banner of Butchery has been around so long, it has absorbed a great deal of primal Orcishness as well as huge quantities of blood</Lore>
					<Description>The unit carrying the Banner of Butchery may, once during the battle, add +1 Attack tо each model fighting for that turn. In the case of mounted models only the rider gets the bonus, not the mount. Once used, the banner has no further effect</Description>

					<Name>The Bashin' Flag of Bork</Name>
					<Points>10</Points>
					<Rule>Ignores the first failed Animosity roll of the game</Rule>
					<Lore>Once carried beside Savage Orc Warchief Bork Crazy-Bear at the infamous Blood River massacre and barbecue. A little of the old chiefs legendary savagery lingers on in the blood-soaked fabric. His ancient spirit drives the greenies onwards and in their eagerness to get at their enemies they forget about attacking each other for a while at least</Lore>
					<Description>The unit which carries the Bashin' Flag of Bork ignores the first failed Animosity roll of the game - it passes the test instead. Any further rolls are taken as normal (even the spirit of Bork Crazy-Bear can only do so much)</Description>

				<Lore>On several occasions, a Greenskin tribe would often employ the service of a Giant by rewarding him with an abundant supply of food regularly. In combat, Giants would often charge mindlessly into the enemy front-lines, usually having a massive club or tree to be used as a weapon. Wearing little to no armour, Giants are highly susceptible to a concentrated volley of crossbows and archers, or a well-placed shot from a Great Cannon. Should the enemy lack missile capability, it is extremely hard to take down a Giant in close-quarters combat.</Lore>
