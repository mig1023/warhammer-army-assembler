			<Description>The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of bestial humanoid barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of the Warhammer World. The term "Greenskins" is a common collective description used by many civilised nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races. The broadest division is between the Orcs, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.\n\nThe Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilisation. These tribal warriors are extremely violent, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known world. Time and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, an ever increasing mass of warfare that has the potential to dominate and cover the entire world in a seething green tide</Description>

				<Lore>Gorbad Ironclaw is one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses. In his day, Gorbad led a massive invasion that almost crushed the Empire. His armies succeeded in slaying Emperor Sigismund and wiping the Imperial province of Solland off the map. Gorbad was a hulking Orc who rose to fame as the leader of the Ironclaw Tribe. It was he who first built the Iron Rock, the most redoubtable Orc fastness in the Old World. Yet conquering greenskin tribes was no real challenge for Gorbad and so he inevitably crossed into the human land of the Empire.</Lore>

				<Lore>Warlord Grom, known more famously as Grom the Pauch or Grom the Fat of the Misty Mountains is not only the largest and most powerful Goblin ever known, but also among the greatest of Greenskin Warbosses, having even invaded the distant lands of Ulthuan in a rampage of violence and destruction. Gobbos are cowardly and disloyal, but nothing stirs their wicked hearts like Grom, mightiest of Goblin Warbosses. Stories of Grom's greatness still command attention around any Goblin camp and if a Shaman should conjure his superlative-sized image, even the most boisterous gobbo will behave with reverence. Grom is said to not have been killed, nor found after the battle. Taking up his infamous' Leutenant's Wyvern, fleeing the battlefield. Grom the Paunch is a reminder to all Goblins, a personification of something they will never be, yet always worship. In question to Games Workshop it is said that Grom's Waaagh was such size, that the very Empire shook for days and nights until they held at bay near Stirland, building hundreds of thousands of vassalized 'Ships', to move the force of millions of Greenskins, towards Ulthuan, making this Waaagh! The most infamous to records ever before and after.</Lore>

				<Lore>Orcs determine their hierarchy in a simple manner - the biggest and best fighter takes control. Goblins follow a less straightforward path to the top ranks, as they are both more devious and more cowardly than their brutish Orc cousins. Underhanded ploys and strategy are the preferred tactics for Goblins; although straight-up fighting is still an option, it is one that is typically left to the especially desperate. All Goblins use dirty tricks, with the best schemers being the most dangerous of their diminutive kind and the most likely to rise through the ranks. Those Goblins that make it to the very top are known as Big Bosses.</Lore>

				<Lore>Unlike Boar Boyz who subdue their mounts before riding them, the Savage Orcs have been known to ride these Boars whenever they are needed. In this instance, a Savage Orc would stalk a wild Boar, subdue it, and ride the beast into battle. This tactic often enrages the Boar into a berserk fury, making the charge of a Savage Orc Boar that more terrifying.</Lore>

				<Image>OrcChariot</Image>
				<Lore>By lashing together roughly hewn logs, the otherwise dull-witted Orcs have managed to create through sheer luck and determination, crude yet formidable war chariots. With the weight of both the two Boars and the chariot itself, this shock cavalry has the potential to break apart even the thickest of enemy formations so long as the chariot still holds together.</Lore>

				<Lore>These riders are simply just crazed Night Goblins who thought it interesting to leap upon the back of his Squig and ride it like a mount. Although the majority of Night Goblins that try these stunts end up being eaten, the ability for the Night Goblin Rider to direct these Squigs unto the enemy have proven so effective that the Night Goblin tribes have begun to field them against their enemies as their own form of light cavalry.</Lore>

An unpredictable asset on the battlefield, the ferocity of the Squigs attacks usually outweighs the catastrophic outcome that would happen should these creatures be let loose without the guidance of a Squig Herder.</Lore>

				<Lore>A primitive version of the Trebuchet, the Orcs and Goblins were first introduced to catapults shortly after they encountered the Dwarfs. These siegecrafts are deployed singularly or in batteries to help soften up enemy formations, smash defensive positions, or to toss Orc warriors over the battlements and into the city. Due to the technicality of the siegecraft, they are often handled by a crew of Goblins rather then Orcs.</Lore>

A Goblin known as Doom Diver would be used live ammunition for this artillery piece, where the Goblin's leathery wings allow it to glide to a specific target where he may impale his victim with the top of his pointy helmet.</Lore>

				<Points>205</Points>
				<Lore>On several occasions, a Greenskin tribe would often employ the service of a Giant by rewarding him with an abundant supply of food regularly. In combat, Giants would often charge mindlessly into the enemy front-lines, usually having a massive club or tree to be used as a weapon. Wearing little to no armour, Giants are highly susceptible to a concentrated volley of crossbows and archers, or a well-placed shot from a Great Cannon. Should the enemy lack missile capability, it is extremely hard to take down a Giant in close-quarters combat.</Lore>
