			<Description>The Vampire Counts are amongst the most legendary factions of Vampires to have ever terrorised the civilised lands of the Old World, all of whom are members of the unholy Von Carstein bloodline. From the Imperial government and the patriotic citizenry of the Empire, the Vampire Counts are considered by many to be fiends without equal. They seek only to topple the civilisations of the living and supplant them with an Undead Empire that will reign forever as Lords of the Night. The Vampire Counts are powerful necromancers as well as warriors, given supernatural enhancements to their strength, cunning, beauty, and ambition. However, these vampires, for all their power and cunning, are ultimately base, selfish creatures driven by the same motivations as the mortals they deem themselves superior to. They are remorseless in their advance, killing without thought of mercy or compassion, and whose motives are entirely based on their own selfish desires. For all their refinement, these vampires are nothing but rotting corpses held together by Dark Magic and the horrific consumption of mortal blood</Description>

					<Lore>The legendary blade of the Undead mercenary, Ennio Mordim; Skabscrath flickers with pale flame. A blade so potent it cannot be sheathed without first taking a life, Skabscrath is possessed of an evil sentience that drives the wielder to ever darker acts. Some claim the blade is more steeped in evil than any Vampire, for it will betray its wielder if its bloodlust is not sated. When unsheathed, Skabscrath emits the terrible screams of all those it has slain, amplified to such a degree that it can cause those who hear them to die of fright</Lore>
					<Description>The bearer has the Devastating Charge and Frenzy special rules, and all close combat attacks made by the bearer have the Flaming Attacks special rule. In addition, the bearer of Skabscrath gains the Death Shriek special rule.

					<Lore>Ensorcelled in pitch darkness in the heart of Castle Drachenfels, the Nightshroud owes more to the otherworld than to reality. Originally fashioned from the death-raiments of King Pharatohep, the Nightshroud has since been soaked in the blood of sorcerers and witches. The aura of gloom that clings to it is so strong it can physically manifest, lashing out with shadowy tendrils that grapple with all those who would strike the wearer</Lore>

					<Description>All Grave Guard, Black Knights and Wight Kings in the same unit as the Banner of the Barrows receive +1 To Hit in close combat.

When Vlad was slain, Mannfred did not involve himself in the infighting that would see Konrad rise to prominence. Instead, he travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of necromantic lore. He made an unholy pilgrimage to the ancient tombs of Nehekhara and the ancient city of Lahmia, where he wrested the secrets of the Liche Priests from bone dry papyrus and scrolls made from human skin.</Lore>

				<Lore>Crypt Ghouls, or simply just Ghouls, are malformed humans whom have devolved themselves into a primitive existence due to the horrible consumption of dead flesh. Unlike the Undead, these still living creatures do not engage their enemy head-on and would rather attack from the shadows where they could use their adept hunting instincts and their poisonous claws to great effect.</Lore>

				<Lore>Spirit Host are those tormented spirits of Humans who were not given rest from their graves and was forcibly summoned by Necromancers or Vampires to do their bidding. On the field of battle, these vengeful apparitions cluster together into hosts that drift slowly towards their warm-blooded victims with terrible inevitability. Even a cannonball strike will not damage a Spirit Host, for they exist only partially in this world. However, their twilight state does not render these spirits harmless. They can claw at a mortal’s flesh with long, taloned hands, stopping the victim’s beating heart with nothing more than a touch.</Lore>

				<Lore>Hexwraiths are born in the very depths of the Underworld, their only goal in the afterlife is to hunt down those evil men who have cheated death. Tearing from the Underworld and into the material world, these Hexwraiths ride from one end of the Old World to another in order to hunt down those that would defy the Death Gods wishes, whether it would be amateur Necromancers or powerful Vampires. Ironically, however, these spirits would often be lured and trapped by the bindings of a Necromancer, and forced to do their bidding.</Lore>

				<Lore>The first Blood Knights were once an honourable brotherhood of Imperial Knights that protected the lands just west of the Imperial province of Wissenland. However, after their horrific transformation into Vampries, these once noble Knights have since become the bearers of the unholy blood of the Blood Dragon bloodline. Their once shining armour is now encrusted with the blood and gore of countless battles, their monstrous steeds ragged and ruined from years of warfare, yet held together by potent necromantic spells. The Blood Knights are nigh indestructible and their thirst for blood makes them ferocious and implacable. Since the creation of the Blood Dragons, many more Blood Knight orders have been founded, from many different families.</Lore>

				<Lore>Cairn Wraiths are amongst the most powerful of the Undead. Though they lack physical form, their touch drains the life of a mortal. Their very presence fills the air with dread, and most who face them are driven mad with fear long before they are killed. Filled with rage, these vengeful spirits fall upon their enemies, tearing them apart with great sweeps of their ancient, magical scythes. In return, those who do stand against them find their pitiful attacks merely pass straight through the Cairn Wraith, making contact with nothing but foul air and tattered robes. It doesn't take long for the Wraiths to punish them for their insolence.</Lore>
