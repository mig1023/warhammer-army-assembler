			<Description>The Daemons of Chaos, known also as the Legions of Chaos, the Arch-Enemy, the Great Beast, or simply just Daemons (not to be confused with other kinds of daemons) are malevolent, otherwordly entities born from the deepest and darkest emotions of all mortal creatures. From their fortresses and palaces within this Realm of Chaos, these entities watch with envious eyes towards the mortal kingdoms, waiting with unblinking patience for their chance to wreak destruction and dismay upon the world and to feed upon the misery that they have wrought.\n\nOf the many forces which permeate the world, both emotional and natural otherwise, there are but only Four which holds supreme power within this plane of unnatural existence. Power/Anger, Lust/Pleasure, Death/Despair and Change/Hope are the four greatest forces which have enthralled the world in its grip, for in a world engulfed in such amounts of war, corruption and disease, their dark presence and their malign influence is all but inevitable, for these dark emotions and thoughts fuel the main four Gods of Chaos, Khorne the Blood God, Slaanesh the Dark Prince, Nurgle the Plaguefather and Tzeentch the Changer of Ways</Description>

				<Name>Skarbrand</Name>
				<Points>655</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>Skarbrand, known also as the Exiled One, the Wrathful Reaper, or the Drinker of Blood, was once the greatest of all Khorne's Daemons, an Exalted Bloodthirster. An eternity of battle in the Blood God's name had brought Skarbrand victories uncounted. It was he who tore down the gates of Slaanesh's first palace and visited ruin therein. It was he who led the eight Hosts of Murder to their triumph over the combined armies of the other Chaos Gods. But his arrogance, hubris and sheer rage, secretly fanned by Tzeentch, grew so great that he actually attacked his Chaos God patron. For this supreme transgression, Skarbrand had his personality and intellect excised by the Blood God, leaving only his rage. He was exiled from the Blood God's Domain and forced to wander the immortal and mortal worlds, where he seeks to atone for his sin and end his exile by piling thousands of new skulls upon the Skull Throne of Khorne.</Lore>

				<Wizard>4</Wizard>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>Kairos Fateweaver, known also as the Oracle of Tzeentch, the Keeper of the Destiny Scrolls, and even the Mocking Watcher, is perhaps the most powerful of the Lords of Change due to the actions of his master, Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways. The Daemon now knows every spell in existence, and every action before it's conceived. Ever since he clawed his way back from the Well of Eternity which he was thrown into by Tzeentch after years uncounted within its depths, Kairos can see things that are hidden even to Tzeentch. Since his return from the Well of Eternity, Kairos has possessed two heads. Kairos' right head sees possible futures as clear as day. No scheme is hidden from its sight and the infinite possibilities of tomorrow crystallise into irrefutable fact. Kairos' left head sees the past without the petty colourations of subjective perspective and bias. Past and future pulse through a body shrivelled and twisted by its passage through the Well of Eternity. Valuable as this vision is, it comes with a heavy cost. Both of Kairos' heads are blind to the present; he cannot see time as it passes - only events that are to come or whose time has already lapsed.</Lore>

				<Lore>The Blue Scribes, sometimes known as Azure Arcanologists, Wandering Wizards, and Tzeentch's Quaestors, are a pair of powerful Blue Horrors which ride their Disc of Tzeentch through realms eternal and mortal, squabbling as they seek fragments of their god Tzeentch lost to the Winds of Magic to bind them with parchment and ink. P'tarix scrawls frantically with a quill crafted from a Lord of Change's pinfeather. Xirat'p reads the written words to check for mistakes; in so doing unleashing the power bound within on any mortal or Daemon unfortunate enough to be nearby.</Lore>

Epidemius' task is an unending one, and it generates a great deal of paperwork, so he rides a palanquin to share the burden - and to more easily force a path through Nurgle's hordes.</Lore>

				<Name>The Masque of Slaanesh</Name>
				<Points>90</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>The Masque of Slaanesh, known also as the Eternal Dancer, Accursed Maiden, and Darkling Deceiver, was once the most favoured of all the Daemonettes. She danced for the joy of performance and wove enrapturing displays so dazzling that they could strike even immortal gods silent with awe. Yet the Masque was undone when Slaanesh suffered his most terrible loss in the Great Game, maneuvered by Tzeentch into a war with Khorne and Nurgle that he could not hope to win. Thinking to ease Slaanesh's mind and ills, the Masque danced for her dark lord. Never before had she performed with such skill. She glided across that ballroom floor of broken dreams and sundered promises, each sensuous and graceful motion flowing effortlessly into the next. No mortal could have watched her dance that eve and remained unmoved, yet Slaanesh was angry at his defeat, and his proud heart filled with the acrid pain of humiliation. As he watched the Daemonette dance her faultless dance, Slaanesh saw only a barbed jest at his expense, a subtle mockery aimed at his wounded pride. All at once, the Dark Prince could bear no more and flew into a terrible rage. He laid a curse upon the Masque, condemning her to dance throughout eternity against her will, unable to rest her limbs or take the merest pause to savour other experiences. Her dances would now speak in testament of Slaanesh's glory, every motion a stylized rendition of one of the Dark Prince's great victories. His ire spent, Slaanesh turned his back upon the Masque and retired to his inner chambers, where the touch of his handmaidens could perhaps temporarily heal his great hurt.</Lore>
