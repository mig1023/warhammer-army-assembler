			<Description>The Daemons of Chaos, known also as the Legions of Chaos, the Arch-Enemy, the Great Beast, or simply just Daemons (not to be confused with other kinds of daemons) are malevolent, otherwordly entities born from the deepest and darkest emotions of all mortal creatures. From their fortresses and palaces within this Realm of Chaos, these entities watch with envious eyes towards the mortal kingdoms, waiting with unblinking patience for their chance to wreak destruction and dismay upon the world and to feed upon the misery that they have wrought.\n\nOf the many forces which permeate the world, both emotional and natural otherwise, there are but only Four which holds supreme power within this plane of unnatural existence. Power/Anger, Lust/Pleasure, Death/Despair and Change/Hope are the four greatest forces which have enthralled the world in its grip, for in a world engulfed in such amounts of war, corruption and disease, their dark presence and their malign influence is all but inevitable, for these dark emotions and thoughts fuel the main four Gods of Chaos, Khorne the Blood God, Slaanesh the Dark Prince, Nurgle the Plaguefather and Tzeentch the Changer of Ways</Description>

					<Description>At the end of every Close Combat phase in which the Daemon causes one or more unsaved Wounds, a unit of Chaos Furies is created. The unit consists of one Chaos Fury for every unsaved Wound caused. The unit must be placed wholly within 6" of the Daemon and cannot be placed with 1" of another unit or impassable terrain. If any model cannot be placed because there isn't enough room, or you do not have sufficient models, it is lost. Units created in this way do not award victory points</Description>

					<Name>The Portalglyph</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Rule>Can choose to keep a single unit in the Realm of Chaos instead of deploying it at the start of the game</Rule>
					<Lore>When the mad mage M'kar created the Portalglyph, he did so to lure Daemons to his service. Alas, M'kar's plans seemingly went awfully awry, for though the Daemons spilled through the breach they returned home soon enough, with both M'kar and the Portalglyph in their grasp. The Portalglyph has been seen many times since. Its creator, on the other hand, seems to have vanished</Lore>
					<Description>If your army contains the Portalglyph, you can choose to keep a single unit in the Realm of Chaos instead of deploying it at the start of the game. The Portalglyph can be placed in any of your Remaining Moves sub-phases. If the bearer is slain, he must immediately place the Portalglyph before being removed as a casualty. In either case, place a counter or other suitable marker within 12" of the bearer and scatter it 3D6" (6D6" if he was slain). If the counter ends up off the board, or within 1" of a unit or impassable terrain, alter the scatter distance by the smallest amount possible to ensure the counter is placed 1" before or beyond the obstruction.\n\nOnce the Portalglyph has been placed, the unit in the Realm of Chaos can enter play through the Portalglyph during the Remaining Moves sub-phase of any subsequent friendly turn. When the unit does so, place it facing any direction, provided that: the unit has at least as many files as it has ranks, the rear of the back rank is in base contact with the counter, no model is more than 12" from the counter, and the unit is not within 1" of another unit, impassable terrain or the board edge. The unit can then move normally (but not march)</Description>

					<Name>The Rock of Inevitability</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Rule>One use only: at the end of any Movement phase place a cursed bulwark (an obstacle up to 8" long) anywhere within 6" of the bearer, at the end of each of your turns, roll a D6: on a score of 1-3 nothing happens; on a score of 4-5 place a further cursed bulwark; on a score of 6 place a cursed tower</Rule>
					<Lore>Deep in the Realm of Chaos sits the Inevitable City. It is an ageless edifice that lies ever distant from those who seek to reach it, and shadows every step taken by those who wish to escape it. The city has been destroyed many times, but has always rebuilt itself — and always will so long as a single stone remains. Indeed, if but one worn brick from its walls is planted in the mortal realm, it is said that a new city will soon arise</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The bearer of the Rock of Inevitability can use it at the end of any Movement phase. Place a cursed bulwark (an obstacle up to 8" long) anywhere within 6" of the bearer. It cannot be placed on top of (or within 1" of) a unit, or placed on a terrain feature other than a hill. At the end of each of your turns, roll a D6. On a score of 1-3 nothing happens. On a score of 4-5 place a further cursed bulwark. On a score of 6 place a cursed tower (a Citadel Watchtower or another building of similar size). Cursed terrain features placed in this way must be positioned touching an existing cursed terrain feature, and cannot be placed on top of a unit, or a terrain feature other than a hill or forest. If the terrain feature cannot be placed, or you don't have the relevant terrain feature, then nothing is placed. Cursed bulwarks are walls, and cursed towers are buildings. A model from the Forces of Order that is in base contact with either a cursed tower or cursed bulwark suffers a -2 penalty to Initiative</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>The Eternal Blade</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Rule>Roll a D3 at the start of each round of combat: the bearer's Weapon Skill, Strength, Initiative and Attacks are increased by this amount until the end of the phase</Rule>
					<Lore>According to legend, the Eternal Blade has been present at every major battle since the dawn of time. It was a sword during the Sack of Braquiron, an axe on the slaughter-fields of Naggra. At the Siege of Kislev, it was a spear in the hand of De’voth the Devolved and, after his death, the dagger that stole the life of the Tsar. Ownership of the Eternal Blade is a guarantee of earning great worldly renown — at least so long as it consents to the bearer’s will</Lore>
					<Description>Roll a D3 at the start of each round of combat - the bearer's Weapon Skill, Strength, Initiative and Attacks are increased by this amount until the end of the phase</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>The Chromatic Tome</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Rule>Can choose to re-roll the Winds of Magic dice in your turn</Rule>
					<Lore>Inked upon these pages are the fundamental secrets of the Winds of Chaos. Alas, the grimoire is a fickle and mischievous Daemon, little given to cooperation. But then, what else would one expect of a Lord of Change forced into a new form for rebellious deeds?</Lore>
					<Description>You can choose to re-roll the Winds of Magic dice in your turn. However, if you do so, your opponent can also re-roll the Winds of Magic dice in his turn, if he wishes. In either case, all of the Winds of Magic dice must be re-rolled</Description>

					<Name>Blade of Blood</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Add To="Strength">1</Add>
					<KillingBlow/>
					<Lore>The weighty Blade of Blood trembles with a portion of Khorne's boundless rage; its strike crushes not only flesh and armour, but the victim's very soul as well</Lore>
					<Description>Attacks made with the Blade of Blood are resolved at +1 Strength. They also have the Killing Blow special rule</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Axe of Khorne</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>+3 Attacks if in base contact three or more enemy models</Rule>
					<Lore>The Gorelords of the First Circle are Bloodthirsters of the highest rank, given the honour of leading the Lord of Skulls' great hosts. Each Gorelord bears an axe that is part Daemon, part battle-notched iron, known as an Axe of Khorne. This weapon is little less blood-hungry than its wielder, and ever spurs its owner to fresh slaughter</Lore>
					<Description>When he attacks with the Axe of Khorne, the wielder receives +3 Attacks if he is in base contact with three or more enemy models</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Wand of Whimsy</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>Whenever the bearer successfully casts or dispels a spell, roll a D6 - the Wand of Whimsy gains a charge on a roll of 5+: The Wand grants the bearer a bonus to both Strength and Attacks equal to the number of charges</Rule>
					<Lore>The Wand of Whimsy was carved from the bones of Krysothos, a Lord of Change who dared to steal a portion of Tzeentch's sorceries. Krysothos is gone now, bound to a feathered grimoire, but his bones linger still and steal magic whenever then can — magic that their wielder can harness to his own ends</Lore>
					<Description>Whenever the bearer successfully casts or dispels a spell, roll a D6 - the Wand of Whimsy gains a charge on a roll of 5+. The Wand of Whimsy grants the bearer a bonus to both Strength and Attacks equal to the number of charges</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Staff of Change</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>Any character or monster that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from the Staff of Change must immediately pass a Toughness test or suffer an additional D6 Wounds with no armour saves allowed</Rule>
					<Lore>Raw chaos flows about the gnarled and writhing Staff of Change, running up and down the stave as tongues of crackling rainbow fire. To be struck by this staff is therefore to feel the touch of change itself, rendered into a mewling and mutating mass by the unstoppable energies of Tzeentch</Lore>
					<Description>Any character or monster that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from the Staff of Change must immediately pass a Toughness test or suffer an additional D6 Wounds with no armour saves allowed. If such a model loses its last Wound to the Staff of Change, it explodes! All models within D6" immediately suffer a single Strength 5 hit</Description>
				</Weapon>

					<Flail/>
					<Test Bet="Wound" Context="Wound" Profile="Toughness"/>
					<Lore>The Plague Flail's heads are the shrunken skulls of plague victims, its chain crafted from knotted and desiccated entrails. Pestilence hangs heavy about it still, ever seeking to escape</Lore>
					<Description>Attacks made with the Plague Flail are resolved at +2 Strength in the first round of combat. Any character or monster that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from the Plague Flail must immediately pass a Toughness test or suffer another Wound with no armour saves allowed</Description>

					<Description>Attacks made with the Balesword have the Poisoned Attacks and Multiple Wounds (D3) special rules</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Witstealer Sword</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Test Bet="Wound" Context="Wound" Profile="Initiative"/>
					<Lore>The Witstealer Sword is a magical Daemon Weapon forged in the molten heat of desire and cooled in a vat of the Chaos God Slaanesh's own blood. Thus did the Dark Prince think to arm his champion, the Keeper of Secrets N'kari, so that he would be fit to defeat the Khornate Bloodthirster Skarbrand</Lore>
					<Description>Any character or monster that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from the Witstealer Sword must immediately pass an Initiative test or suffer another Wound with no armour saves allowed</Description>

					<Lore>The cords of the whip known as the Lash of Despair are spun soul-stuff, hungry for escape. When the lash cracks forward, the soul-streamers splay outward, striking wildly at all nearby</Lore>

				<Name>Skarbrand</Name>
				<Points>610</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>Skarbrand, known also as the Exiled One, the Wrathful Reaper, or the Drinker of Blood, was once the greatest of all Khorne's Daemons, an Exalted Bloodthirster. An eternity of battle in the Blood God's name had brought Skarbrand victories uncounted. It was he who tore down the gates of Slaanesh's first palace and visited ruin therein. It was he who led the eight Hosts of Murder to their triumph over the combined armies of the other Chaos Gods. But his arrogance, hubris and sheer rage, secretly fanned by Tzeentch, grew so great that he actually attacked his Chaos God patron. For this supreme transgression, Skarbrand had his personality and intellect excised by the Blood God, leaving only his rage. He was exiled from the Blood God's Domain and forced to wander the immortal and mortal worlds, where he seeks to atone for his sin and end his exile by piling thousands of new skulls upon the Skull Throne of Khorne.</Lore>

				<Character/>
				<Lore>Kairos Fateweaver, known also as the Oracle of Tzeentch, the Keeper of the Destiny Scrolls, and even the Mocking Watcher, is perhaps the most powerful of the Lords of Change due to the actions of his master, Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways. The Daemon now knows every spell in existence, and every action before it's conceived. Ever since he clawed his way back from the Well of Eternity which he was thrown into by Tzeentch after years uncounted within its depths, Kairos can see things that are hidden even to Tzeentch. Since his return from the Well of Eternity, Kairos has possessed two heads. Kairos' right head sees possible futures as clear as day. No scheme is hidden from its sight and the infinite possibilities of tomorrow crystallise into irrefutable fact. Kairos' left head sees the past without the petty colourations of subjective perspective and bias. Past and future pulse through a body shrivelled and twisted by its passage through the Well of Eternity. Valuable as this vision is, it comes with a heavy cost. Both of Kairos' heads are blind to the present; he cannot see time as it passes - only events that are to come or whose time has already lapsed.</Lore>

				<Character/>
				<Lore>The Masque of Slaanesh, known also as the Eternal Dancer, Accursed Maiden, and Darkling Deceiver, was once the most favoured of all the Daemonettes. She danced for the joy of performance and wove enrapturing displays so dazzling that they could strike even immortal gods silent with awe. Yet the Masque was undone when Slaanesh suffered his most terrible loss in the Great Game, maneuvered by Tzeentch into a war with Khorne and Nurgle that he could not hope to win. Thinking to ease Slaanesh's mind and ills, the Masque danced for her dark lord. Never before had she performed with such skill. She glided across that ballroom floor of broken dreams and sundered promises, each sensuous and graceful motion flowing effortlessly into the next. No mortal could have watched her dance that eve and remained unmoved, yet Slaanesh was angry at his defeat, and his proud heart filled with the acrid pain of humiliation. As he watched the Daemonette dance her faultless dance, Slaanesh saw only a barbed jest at his expense, a subtle mockery aimed at his wounded pride. All at once, the Dark Prince could bear no more and flew into a terrible rage. He laid a curse upon the Masque, condemning her to dance throughout eternity against her will, unable to rest her limbs or take the merest pause to savour other experiences. Her dances would now speak in testament of Slaanesh's glory, every motion a stylized rendition of one of the Dark Prince's great victories. His ire spent, Slaanesh turned his back upon the Masque and retired to his inner chambers, where the touch of his handmaidens could perhaps temporarily heal his great hurt.</Lore>
