			<Description>The Kingdom of Bretonnia, also known as the Land of Chivalry, is a highly martial feudal kingdom that lies between the lands of the Grey Mountains and the Great Ocean. Bretonnia is second only in size to that of the Empire, both their chief rival and closest ally, having a culture and society that revolves around the ideals of nobility, social birthright, and the upholding of a strictly enforced code of chivalry.\n\nRuled by a Royarch, the nation of Bretonnia has been known throughout the kingdoms of man for having the greatest Knights in the entire Old World, even surpassing that of the Knightly Orders of the Empire. A proud and honourable kingdom, the armies of Bretonnia are comprised mostly of knights and noblemen, who ride into battle with lance, horse, and sword, seeking glory and rooting out injustice wherever they go. The Knights of Bretonnia are trained to fight from childhood, and even the lowliest Knights Errant are considered superior to ordinary warriors. Their skills are further enhanced through constant training, battles and tournaments. It is not only Bretonnia's knights who are famed, however, for the kingdom also boasts the finest human sailors in the World. With their great sails billowing in the wind, Bretonnia's mighty fleets are a majestic sight on the high seas. Due to this regime, the combined military might of Bretonnia has surpassed that of even the greatest armies in history</Description>

					<Lore>It is believed that the knight Agilulf once wore this armour, but in folklore it is claimed that Agilulf never actually existed, and that the armour was possessed of a will of its own. When the knight was slain, if indeed he was alive, the armour was found to be empty, and its shining brilliance gradually faded until it was its current, dark colour. Despite his mythical status amongst Bretonnia's lowborn, Agilulf did in fact exist. He was a renowned and mighty Grail Knight, held in high regard by Couronne's nobility.

					<NoMultiWounds/>
					<Lore>Sirienne's Locket is a protective magical charm often carried by Bretonnian knights.

She gifts her paramours with one of these exquisite charms to wear about their hearts, with a likeness of the Lady of the Lake on one half of the locket and her own on the other. The fact that more than one knight claims to own Sirienne's Locket says more about its creator than its bearer</Lore>
					<Description>A Knight with Sirienne's Locket can never suffer more than one-wound in any one phase from non-magical attacks - even multiple wound weapons (including war machines) can only cause a single wound. After the first wound in that phase is suffered, all subsequent wounds suffered during that phase are ignored.

					<Description>If the hearer is ever reduced to 1 Wound, then the Knight instantly gains a 3+ Ward save. If the character suffers multiple wounds that would kill him hefore he has gained this Ward save (eg, if he has more than one wound left and is hit by a cannon ball), he will be reduced to 1 Wound, then may attempt his 3+ Ward save to stay alive and nullify any further wounds caused by the same hit</Description>

					<Description>One use only. The Braid may be used at the start of any Bretonnian turn. Until the beginning of the next Bretonnian turn, the character's Leadership value is increased by 1. In addition, once the Braid has been used, until the start of the next Bretonnian turn, the model bearing the Braid and any unit he is with can move over marsh, rivers, lakes or any other water features without penalty and will benefit from soft cover while in such terrain</Description>

				<Lore>The basic front-line infantry that comprises most Bretonnian armies. These men have been chosen from a very young age to be trained and equipped with basic weaponry and gear and fight on the behalf of their lord. Wearing mostly chainmail armour, these reluctant but adequate soldiers are responsible for defending a noble master's castle, or holding the line against the enemy with shield and spear, whilst the knights upon their mighty warhorses attack from the flanks and bring victory.</Lore>

				<Lore>Commoners that are not fit to join the men-at-arms companies are often press-ganged at need into military service as basic support units. As such, archers are a common and readily formed unit within most Bretonnian armies as all peasants and commoners within Bretonnia are required to maintain a proficiency with the bow. Their willingness is reinforced by the promised bounty of a single copper coin for any who survive the campaign, an exception from tithing and the right to loot the enemy fallen, which is to any peasant a potential princely fortune. Unfortunately, as with most Bretonnian infantry units, these men aren't very reliable soldiers.</Lore>

				<Lore>These experienced soldiers provide the Bretonnian army with dedicated skirmishers or fast light cavalry and scouts. Grizzled veterans, they have fought and survived many battles with only their skill in arms and unwavering bravery. Such is their combat experience that yeomen are almost as skilled as any Knight of the Realm, but such a boast is often ignored and even suppressed by the nobility. When promoted to the rank of a yeomen, these men are often divided between mounted scout yeomanry or becoming serjeants within a men-at-arms company.</Lore>

				<Lore>These mighty knights represent the very pinnacle of Bretonnian chivalry, honour, and bravery. Those Questing Knights who have drunk from the Holy Grail are blessed with the powers of the Lady and have thus been proven worthy to become Grail Knights. To obtain the position of a Grail Knight is the ultimate goal for all knights, and to become one is to be the very embodiment of a holy warrior. It is said that the Grail Knights are the greatest of mankind's warriors to walk the earth.</Lore>

				<Lore>Immense siege engines used to lob large projectiles at enemy formations from a safe distance. The machine itself can vary greatly in design, and the projectiles thrown can range in weight from a cannonball-sized rock up to something as large as a peasant's hovel. Due to its reputation as a dishonourable weapon and the lack of any proper education amongst the common people, only a handful of craftsmen have the skills and knowledge to build such expensive and time-consuming devices. Thus with only a finite number of engineers available for hire and no consistent quality or qualifications amongst them, trebuchets are usually scratch-built onsite using whatever materials lay at hand, and are then stripped down again for scrap with only the valuable iron-forged parts travelling from siege to siege along with the hired engineer that forged them.</Lore>
