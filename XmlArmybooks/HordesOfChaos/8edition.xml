			<Description>The Warriors of Chaos, also known as the Hordes of Chaos, the Followers of Chaos, Chaos Undivided, the Northern Barbarians or simply just the Northmen, are the names given to a race of savage, warlike tribes of Human Barbarians that occupy the harsh and unforgiving lands of the uppermost North, known in the lands of the Old World as the dreaded Northern Waste.\n\nTo all those that face them, the northern barbarians are considered by all to be the enemies of all the world, whose unwavering worship to an uncaring and sadistic pantheon of ancient and evil gods has given them a single driving motive to usher in the inevitable downfall of all mortal-kind into their hellish enslavement.\n\nOut of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Hellfire sword</Name>
					<Points>65</Points>
					<MultiWounds>D3</MultiWounds>
					<NoArmour/>
					<Rule>Flaming attacks</Rule>
					<Rule>After all close combat blows have been struck, roll a D6 for every foe slain: on the roll of a 6, the slain foe's body explodes, inflicting an additional D6 Strength 4 hits on the enemy unit with the Flaming Attacks special rule</Rule>
					<Rule>At the end of each turns, roll a D6: on the roll of a 1, he suffers one Wound with no armour saves allowed</Rule>
					<Lore>This blade was made from a single, searing flame that was hammered into materialform and quenched in the blood of a fire-djinn. Those struck by it are set ablaze and may explode as their blood turns to liquidfire. The Hellfire Sword was first wielded by the Chaos Lord Garathor but, over time, it consumed his lifeforce until nought remained within his armour but ash. When the Hellfire Sword was prised from Garathor s ruined gauntlet years later, it flared so hotly that it fused into its new owner’s hand. Eventually, this fool’s spirit was also consumed, and the cycle began anew. Since its creation, a hundred mortals have borne this flame-wreathed blade, unaware of their doom until it was too late</Lore>
					<Description>Close combat attacks made with the Hellfire Sword have the Flaming Attacks and Multiple Wounds (D3) special rules. No armour saves can be taken against Wounds caused by the Hellfire Sword. After all close combat blows have been struck, roll a D6 for every foe slain by the Hellfire Sword - on the roll of a 6, the slain foe's body explodes, inflicting an additional D6 Strength 4 hits on the enemy unit with the Flaming Attacks special rule. Unsaved Wounds inflicted in this way count towards the combat result. At the end of each of the wielder's turns, roll a D6; on the roll of a 1, he suffers one Wound with no armour saves allowed</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Sword of Change</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Rule>If an enemy character or monster is slain in close combat, roll a D6: on the roll of a 4+, the model is transformed into a Chaos Spawn under the control of the owner of the Sword of Change</Rule>
					<Lore>The Sword of Change was wrought within the magical balestorm of the northern Chaos Gate. It was fashioned by the Daemon Warlord Amon 'Chakai, whose fossilised eye is still grasped in the weapon s pommel. The Sword of Change is saturated with the mutating power of Chaos. Even the air around the blade is in flux: at one moment, the blade is wreathed with the scent of sweet perfumes, only to be replaced a heartbeat later with the stench of rot and decay. An eye-blink later and the air around the Sword of Change shines with multicoloured hues before being surrounded in a haze of misted blood. This magical sword has the power to reduce those whose flesh it pierces into mindless, flailing mounds of flesh, warping their bodies into monstrosities known as Chaos Spawn</Lore>
					<Description>If an enemy character or monster is slain by the Sword of Change in close combat, roll a D6. On the roll of a 4+, the model is transformed into a Chaos Spawn under the control of the owner of the Sword of Change, exactly as if the enemy model were a Chaos Champion that had suffered a Spawndom result on the Eye of the Gods table</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Filth Mace</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Dependencies>
						<On>Mark of Nurgle</On>
					</Dependencies>
					<Terror/>
					<PoisonAttack/>
					<MultiWounds>D3</MultiWounds>
					<Lore>This rusted mace drips with Nurgle’s choicest plagues and bears an enchantment that ensnares the souls of those crushed beneath its fllth-encrusted mass. The screams of these spirits are deafening and fearsome in equal measure, but they are as nothing compared to the terror caused when a fresh soul is bound to the mace, fuelling an epidemic growth of new disease: the wails turn into phlegm-choked laughter and the steady drip of pestilence becomes a weeping floo</Lore>
					<Description>Model with Mark of Nurgle only. Close combat attacks made with the Filth Mace have the Poisoned Attacks special rule. Once the wielder has killed an enemy model in close combat, he immediately gains the Terror special rule and, from the start of the next Close Combat phase (friend or foe), all subsequent Attacks made with the Filth Mace that result in a successful Poisoned Attack have the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Helm of Many Eyes</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<HitFirst/>
					<Stupidity/>
					<Add To="Armour">6</Add>
					<Lore>This helm is covered with eyeballs that stare into the world as it was, as it is, and as it shall once be. The stream of visions can overwhelm the bearer, but those who can sift through the bombardment of images are truly terrifying foes. They attack with preternatural reflexes, foreseeing their foe’s actions and striking them down before they can even raise their swords. The only vision the helm never reveals is the moment of its wearer’s demise, making it impossible for the champion to avoid such a fate. Upon the wearer’s death, a new boil appears on the helm’s surface. In time this bursts, revealing a new eyeball — the exact match of the previous owner - to join the helm’s ever-growing collection</Lore>
					<Description>The bearer of the Helm of Many Eyes counts his armour save as being one higher than normal. In addition, the bearer has both the Always Strikes First and Stupidity special rules</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Skull of Katam</Name>
					<Points>15</Points>
					<Rule>Can choose to consult Skull of Katam before attempting to channel power dice: if he does so, roll 6 dice instead of 1, but the bearer suffers a -1 Leadership penalty for the rest of the game for every result of a 1 rolled</Rule>
					<Lore>Upon his death, the skull of the daemonologist Katam was daubed with runes using the blood of the Chaos Dragon Baudros. The skull continues to utter words of power, and a wizard who listens may learn many arcane secrets. However, every time the bearer consults the skull, there is a chance it will reveal one of the true mysteries of the Realm of Chaos, imparting knowledge that blasts the mind with its scope and impossibility. In time, the skull's whisperings drive its owner insane, reducing him to a drooling madman whose gibberings are joined only by the eerie sound of Katam s laughter</Lore>
					<Description>The bearer of the Skull of Katam can choose to consult it before attempting to channel power dice. If he does so, roll 6 dice instead of 1. If the bearer consulted the Skull of Katam, he suffers a -1 Leadership penalty for the rest of the game for every result of a 1 rolled when channelling - if it is ever reduced to 0, he is immediately removed as a casualty. A Wizard with the Mark of Tzeentch may not re-roll channelling results of a 1 when using the Skull of Katam</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Chalice of Chaos</Name>
					<Points>10</Points>
					<Rule>Chalice of Chaos: consult the table</Rule>
					<Lore>On the eve before the Fall of Praag Asavar Kul gathered his champions to drink from the Chalice of Chaos, a vessel that contained the boiling blood of a Daemon. As KuTs minions swallowed, their bodies were wrought with changes, and those that survived were infused with power. Once the last drop of ichor was drained, the chalice shattered and disappeared in a cloud of smoke. The vessel was thought lost until the Sorcerer Kharon Baal rediscovered it decades later — mysteriously repaired and filled with fresh blood — at the base of the monolith raised to honour Kul'sfell deeds. Several times since has this cup been drunk from, shattering into fragments every time only to reappear years later. Countless mortals have sought out this fabled chalice, only too eager to risk eternal damnation for a fleeting chance at ultimate glory</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The bearer of the Chalice of Chaos may drink from it at the start of any phase. If he chooses to do so, roll a D6 and consult the table below.\n\nD6 Result\n1 Unworthy Fool: The imbiber immediately suffers a Wound, with no saves of any kind allowed.\n2 Inhuman Speed: The imbiber gains the Always Strikes First special rule until the end of the turn.\n3 Regenerating Flesh: The imbiber gains the Regeneration special rule until the end of the turn.\n4 Dark Fortune: The imbiber gains a 5+ ward save until the end of the turn.\n5 Daemonic Strength: The imbiber gains the Killing Blow special rule until the end of the turn.\n6 Final Transformation: If the imbiber is already a Daemon Prince, he instead treats this result as Unworthy Fool. Otherwise, he must immediately take a Leadership test. If passed, he is gifted with Daemonhood, as described on the Eye of the Gods table on page 25. If failed, he is gifted with Spawndom, as described on the same table</Description>

					<Name>Pendant of Slaanesh</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Dependencies>
						<On>Mark of Slaanesh</On>
					</Dependencies>
					<Rule>Whenever character or his unit take a Break test, it is taken on one less dice than usual</Rule>
					<Rule>For each unsaved Wound the bearer suffers, he gains +1 Attack for the rest of the battle</Rule>
					<Lore>This pendant was craftedfrom the crystallised soul of the first human to have been seduced by Slaanesh. When worn, it comes to life, burrowing deep into the owner's chest, inflicting hours of agony as it slowly scratches through skin, flesh and bone before nestling next to the champions heart. Once there, it invigorates the bearer with sublime energy whenever he feels pain and instills a euphoric state that even the fear of death cannot mar. Once a warrior has tasted this ecstasy, they will jealously guard the pendant, surrounding themselves only with loyal followers and shunning the company of rival champions lest they try and take it for themselves</Lore>
					<Description>Model with Mark of Slaanesh only. The bearer of the Pendant of Slaanesh can only join units that have the Mark of Slaanesh. No other character may join the same unit as the bearer and he cannot join units that already contain a character. Whenever the bearer, or his unit, take a Break test, it is taken on one less dice than usual (note that a Break test cannot be passed with Insane Courage on a single D6). In addition, for each unsaved Wound the bearer suffers, he gains +1 Attack for the rest of the battle</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Blasted Standard</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Dependencies>
						<On>Mark of Tzeentch</On>
					</Dependencies>
					<Rule>Each time the character, or his unit, suffer a hit from a shooting attack, roll a D6 immediately before rolling To Wound: on the roll of 2+, the Strength of that hit is halved, if the result is a 1, the Strength of that hit is instead doubled</Rule>
					<Lore>Woven from threads of pure magic, this standard is inscribed with runes that constantly writhe, and surrounded with the coruscating fires of change. These magical flames shield Tzeentchs followers, leaping out to intercept enemy missiles and transforming them according to the Lord of Fate's whim. Volleys of arrows might be transformed into clouds of feathers, shoals offish or puffs of multi-hued smoke whilst falling rocks and hurtling cannonballs may be altered into snowballs or piles of toads. However, such is Tzeentch's fickle natyre that these flames occasionally change a spent shot into a bolt of lightning or a spinning shard of crystal that punches into one of his followers with devastating — and often fatal — force</Lore>
					<Description>Model with Mark of Tzeentch only. Each time the bearer, or his unit, suffer a hit from a shooting attack, roll a D6 immediately before rolling To Wound. On the roll of 2+, the Strength of that hit is halved. However, if the result is a 1, the Strength of that hit is instead doubled. Attacks that do not roll To Wound, or that wound automatically, are not affected by the Blasted Standard</Description>
				</Banner>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of Rage</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Dependencies>
						<On>Mark of Khorne</On>
					</Dependencies>
					<Frenzy/>
					<Rule>Will never lose their Frenzy, even if beaten in close combat</Rule>
					<Lore>Sewn from strings of congealed gore, this banner radiates bloodlust so strong that those beneath it are goaded into a state of permanent rage. There is a prophecy written in the Tome of Blood of a great champion who will carry the Banner of Rage across a river of blood and be granted the gift of Daemonhood. To date, no mortal has been rewarded so, for none have lived long enough. The promise of immortality draws Khorne's followers from across the world, each challenger believing that they alone are the one the prophecy speaks of, each ready to pluck the banner from the dead fingers of its current bearer</Lore>
					<Description>Model with Mark of Khorne only. The bearer of the Banner of Rage can only join units that are completely comprised of models with the Mark of Khorne. Only characters that have the Mark of Khorne may join the same unit as the bearer. Whilst the bearer is alive, neither he, nor his unit, can ever lose their Frenzy special rule. If the bearer joins a unit that has lost its Frenzy, the unit immediately regains the Frenzy special rule</Description>

				<Lore>Archaon is the thirteenth Everchosen of Chaos Undivided, the Three-Eyed King, the Lord of the End Times and the self-proclaimed supreme champion of the four major Chaos Gods who was sent to command the last and greatest Chaos incursion during the apocalyptic age known simply as the End Times. Out of all the Everchosen of Chaos who have assailed the Known World over the ages, Archaon is by far the most ruthless and perhaps the most powerful. He is an individual that shall decide the fate of entire nations, whose sword can lay waste to heroes and armies and whose unbreakable will can break and dominate those of gods. Archaon is truly the Herald of the Apocalypse, blessed with dreadful artefacts of ancient evil, each one bestowed as a reward for accomplishing impossible trials.</Lore>

				<Name>Sigvald the Magnificent</Name>
				<Points>375</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>Sigvald is a Chaos Lord of Slaanesh who was the son of a powerful Norscan warlord and his sister. He was born beautiful at birth, save for a horned birthmark on the back of his neck, and was spoiled by his father. He was eventually disowned by his father and expelled from his tribe after his father discovered his fondness for Human flesh. Sigvald killed his father in his sleep and departed for the Chaos Wastes where Slaanesh became his divine patron. Now, Sigvald marches at the head of a Chaos army devoted to himself and Slaanesh. He eradicates anyone he deems to be ugly, crude or irritating and burns down cities on a whim. One story even suggests that he destroyed the town of Chamburg because the wine there was not to his taste. He is spoiled by Slaanesh and is described as being extremely self-centred. In fact, he and his elite bodyguard bear mirrored shields so that Sigvald may look at himself at all times while in the midst of battle. His gifts from Slaanesh have left him beautiful on the outside, but have rotted his soul beyond all hope of redemption. The ground literally reshapes itself for him and his feet float an inch above the world's surface, so that he might never be sullied by dust or grime. He wears Chaos Armour of ensorcelled gold that never rusts or gets dirty and fights with Silverslash, a rapier of silver forged from a fragment of the sword of Slaanesh himself.</Lore>

				<Character/>
				<Image>Valkia</Image>
				<Lore>Valkia is a Daemon Princess of Khorne who is said to also be the consort of the Blood God. Valkia was once the queen of a great tribe of the Norscans called the Schwarzvolf. She gained the attention of Khorne when she slew anyone in her tribe who questioned her right to rule. She then moved on to killing other Chaos Lords and the most powerful Champions of the other Chaos Gods. One such was Locephax, a Daemon Prince of Slaanesh who was attracted to her and asked her to serve in his harem as a slave girl. This angered Valkia and the warrior queen killed the Daemon Prince in a duel and then proceeded to place his decapitated head on her shield. Khorne was from then on her patron god and she made a pact to fight her way north to the Realm of Chaos and place her shield with the Slaaneshi Daemon Prince's head upon it before the throne of Khorne. But on her journey north she was killed in battle during an assault by Slaaneshi Daemons. Khorne raged at her passing, and claimed her soul and brought her from the dead as a Daemon Princess in a new form more pleasing to him. Valkia now bears the legs of a Bloodletter and the wings of a bat. Valkia carries the spear Slaupnir, wears the Scarlet Armour and bears a Daemonshield upon which the Blood God mounted the head of the still-aware Locephax.</Lore>

				<Lore>Vilitch was a Chaos Sorcerer of Tzeentch who was born with a fraternal twin. Vilitch was born wretched and tiny while his twin brother Thomin was strong and vital. As such, Thomin was more favoured by his family while Vilitch was forced to do the chores around his home and worked as an apprentice to the village shaman. After praying to Tzeentch one night for a change in his circumstances, Vilitch awoke to discover his body had been fused to that of his brother, who had become his mindless slave. Vilitch proceeded to destroy the his home village, kill all of its inhabitants and become a Sorcerer Lord who commanded a mighty army of Tzeentch. In battle, Vilitch's brother Thomin can store magical power for Vilitch and even absorb the Winds of Magic that aid the wizards of an enemy force.</Lore>

These warriors are barbaric to the extreme, wearing almost nothing but fur garments, wielding crude war-axes and bearing wrought metal shields. Nevertheless, these Marauders are rightfully feared for their unnatural savagery and brutality in combat.</Lore>

				<Lore>These hulking, centaur-like beings that look like a hybrid between an Ogre and a Dragon, hence their name, are amongst the most powerful and most ancient of the Known World's living creatures. Their incredible longevity, as with almost all things supernatural, is the work of the Chaos Gods. Aeons ago, the elders of their race made a pact with the Ruinous Powers, embracing damnation in order to save themselves from a slow decline into extinction. They were given eternal life, and in return, the entire Dragon Ogre race put themselves at the command of the Dark Gods. Since that day, the Dragon Ogres have carved their names across the ages as immortals who can only die in battle, monstrous beings that rouse themselves only in the name of destruction. The Dragon Ogres look forward to a time when their eternal bondage will end with the destruction of the world by Chaos. Amid the lightning and thunder of the apocalypse, they believe that their entire race will wake once again. Until then, these creatures bring death to the enemies of Chaos in preparation for the End Times, hewing bodies with every sweep of their blades and swipe of their monstrous claws.</Lore>
