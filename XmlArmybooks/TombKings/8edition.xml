			<Description>The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.\n\nLong ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Destroyer of Eternities</Name>
					<Points>80</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<AddToStrength>2</AddToStrength>
					<HeroicKillingBlow/>
					<Lore>The bloodthirsty King Nekhesh was the first to wield this massive, ornate blade in battle, severing limbs and heads with every sweeping blow. Imbued with powerful incantations, the blade of this weapon is impossibly sharp and can cleave through armour, flesh and bone with equal ease. Furthermore, this weapon is said to destroy the souls of its victims, thereby denying them any hope of reaching the afterlife. The Destroyer of Eternities was thus greatly feared in ancient Nehekhara, and to be slain by its cursed blade was considered a fate infinitely worse than mere death</Lore>
					<Description>Tomb King on foot only. Attacks made with the Destroyer of Eternities are at +2 Strength, and have the Heroic Killing Blow special rule. The wielder can choose to exchange all of his Attacks to make a special 'Sweeping Attack' - if he does so, all enemy models in base contact with the wielder suffer a single automatic hit (also at +2 Strength and with Heroic Killing Blow). If a target is a character riding a chariot or monster, then both the rider and mount each take a single automatic hit. In a challenge, only the models engaged in the challenge count as being in base contact with the Tomb King</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Blade of Antarhak</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Regeneration/>
					<Rule>For every unsaved Wound inflicted by the Blade of Antarhak, the wielder immediately regains a single Wound lost earlier in the battle. If the bearer is already at his starting number of Wounds and inflicts another unsaved Wound with this weapon, he gains the Regeneration special rule until the end of the next player turn</Rule>
					<Lore>Forgedfor the Tomb Prince Antarhak, this weapon draws the life energy from the sla in and suffuses the wielder with the stolen essence. Those whose bodies are pierced by this cursed blade age decades in mere seconds, their once powerful frames reduced to withered husks in the span of a few heartbeats. At the foe’s vitality is sapped, the wielder’s wounds heal, and a semblance of youth returns, if only temporarily, to their time-ravagedfeatures</Lore>
				</Weapon>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Golden Death Mask of Kharnut</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<Terror/>
					<Rule>Enemy units within 6" of the wearer cannot make use of their general's Inspiring Presence special rule or their Battle Standard Bearer's Hold Your Ground special rule</Rule>
					<Lore>According to Nehekharan beliefs, in the afterlife the gods would bestow each king with a body of gold. Thus, when Prince Khamut awoke from his death-sleep he was horrified at his withered, skeletal visage and demanded the Mortuary Cult fashion for him a magnificent golden death mask. However, when the mask was being sealed around Khanut's head, a drop of molten goldfell upon the Prince’s embalmed body, immolating him in a fiery blaze. The Prince’s spirit was not destroyed, but was mystically bound within the expressionless mask. The taint of death hangs heavy upon the death mask, gripping the hearts of all who gaze upon it</Lore>
					<Description>The model wearing this mask causes Terror. In addition, enemy units within 6" of the wearer cannot make use of their general's Inspiring Presence special rule or their Battle Standard Bearer's Hold Your Ground special rule</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Cloak of The Dunes</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<Rule>Fly</Rule>
					<Lore>This fabled cloak is said to have been created by Khsar the Faceless, the god of the desert who took on the form on the elemental wind. The Cloak of the Dunes is infused with the magic of the deserts, enabling the wearer to transform himself into a whirling cloud of sand. As the bearer moves across the desert, a cone of sharp sand follows in his wake that can strip flesh from bone</Lore>
					<Description>Infantry character on foot only. The wearer of the Cloak of Dunes has the Fly special rule. In addition, if the bearer moves over an unengaged enemy unit in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, that enemy unit immediately suffers 2D6 Strength 2 hits, resolved as for shooting attacks. The bearer can move over several enemy units in the same turn if you wish, causing damage to every unit. The same target unit cannot be affected more than once in the same turn</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Arcana>
					<Name>Neferra's Scrolls of Mighty Incantations</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>One use only. A Wizard can declare that he is using Neferra's Scrolls of Mighty Incantations immediately before casting a spell. If he does so, the Wizard must add a number of extra bonus dice, equal to his Wizard level, to the power dice he is going to roll (you still need to roll at least one dice from the power pool). The bonus dice do not count as power dice. However, a roll of any double when casting a spell using them will cause irresistible force (and a miscast)</Rule>
					<Lore>Neferra, High Priestess to King Khutef, committed her lifetime of knowledge to eight enchanted scrolls so that it would never be lost. The ink with which the hieroglyphs were inscribed was mixed with the blood of sacrificed slaves, each drop being individually blessed in a week-long ritual. Each scroll took over a decade of painstaking work to complete, but the raw power imbued within them can transform the simplest incantation into an unstoppable hurricane of power. Neferra was so paranoid that a rival might steal her sacred scrolls that she also wrought powerful curses onto the parchments that would bring about an unwitting thief’s destruction</Lore>
				</Arcana>
				<Arcana>
					<Name>Enkhil's Kanopi</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Bound spell (Power Level 3). If cast successfully, roll a D6 for every 'remains in play' spell on the tabletop: on a 2+ that spell is automatically dispelled. For each spell that is ended in this way, add D3 power dice to your power pool</Rule>
					<Lore>Within this inauspicious clay vessel is the ancient heart of High Priest Enkhil, removed from his corpse when he was embalmed and entombed within the great necropolis of Mahrak. Enkhil was a jealous and powerful priest, and his undying essence is contained within his shrivelled heart to this day. When the vulture-headed lid is opened, this canopicjar sucks the swirling magical energy from the air, drawing the power into the vessel itself. Enkhil's Kanopi is much sought after, as it can not only thwart the sorceries of enemy wizards, but also strengthen a Liche Priest’s own incantations</Lore>
				</Arcana>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Standard of The Undying Legion</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>Bound spell (power level 5). This banner contains an augment spell that can only be cast on the bearer's unit. If sucessfully cast, the bearer's unit immediately recovers D6+2 Wounds' worth of models, as described in Resurrecting Fallen Warriors</Rule>
					<Lore>This great standard once decorated the tomb of King Lahm izzar’s Jackal Legion, the elite Tomb Guard of Quatar. Every one of these warriors, the fiercest of all the king’s army, swore their oath of eternal servitude under the shadow of this banner, slitting their palms and daubing the standard’s top - a likeness of Djafi the jackal-headed god of the dead — in their own blood. The spirits of Lahmizzar’s legion live on within this ancient icon to this day. Whenever the Standard of the Undying Legion is taken forth into battle, these warrior-spirits restore the fallen and inhabit their bodies to fight again andfulfil their undying pledge</Lore>
				</Banner>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of The Hidden Dead</Name>
					<Points>90</Points>
					<Rule>Nominate one of your units of infantry, cavalry, or chariots with the Nehekharan Undead rule that has yet to deploy, whose total points value is no greater than 150 points. That unit gains the Entombed Beneath the Sands special rule (see page 29). When this unit arrives on the battlefield you must place its 'Entombed Beneath the Sands' marker within 12" of the Banner of the Hidden Dead. If the bearer of this banner is destroyed before the hidden unit emerges, the entire hidden unit is destroyed and removed as casualties. In addition, every unit with the Entombed Beneath the Sands special rule that attempts to emerge whilst its marker is within 12" of the Banner ot the Hidden Dead (including your nominated hidden unit) can re-roll the scatter and artillery dice when emerging. Note that you must either re-roll both, or neither of the dice</Rule>
					<Lore>Belonging to the fabled Hawk Legion, the elite army who guarded Settra before his mummification, the Banner of the Hidden Dead summons the souls of one of their regiments from their honoured place in the Underworld. Wrought with powerful incantations, the ancient dead are called to this banner like moths to a flame. The magic of the banner then binds these souls into the skeletal remains of warriors who have long lain buried andforgotten beneath the sands. At a wordless command, skeletal soldiers punch through the desert surface, forming into perfect ranks or long-dead charioteers burst forth from the dunes for the first time in millenia, ready to wage war once more for the glory of Nehekhara</Lore>

				<Points>130</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>A prince who killed his own family to usurp his brother's throne. He was cast down and as punishment, he was entombed alive with countless desert scarabs which devoured his still living flesh. Once this punishment was complete, the tomb was opened and his skull was cast into the desert- so great were his crimes, he was denied a permanent crypt. Usirian, the god of death, claimed his soul but the Prince struck a bargain with the god- Apophas would be granted undeath in order to search the world for a perfect soul to take his place in the realm of the dead. Thus Apophas was reborn, his body now taking the form of man-shaped swarm of desert scarabs, with his skull on top in place of a head, the body wielding the same knife he used to murder his own family. Unknown to Apophas, Usirian tricked him, as no soul is ever exactly equal to another, thus Apophas is doomed to spend eternity sending souls to Usirian.</Lore>

				<Lore>Ramhotep the Visionary was perhaps the greatest Necrotect in history. His craftsmanship was second to none, and it is said that his statues in the Valley of Kings were so lifelike that the Priest Kings of Nehekhara believed the gods themselves had returned to the mortal world. He designed the Grand Necropolis of Resetra, the Monuments of Eternal Death in Zandri, the Monoliths of the Great Plains and many other architectural wonders. However, Ramhotep took credit for not one of these grand monuments, for to do so would have been tantamount to signing his own death warrant.</Lore>

				<Points>100</Points>
				<Lore>Tomb Princes are the sons of the Tomb Kings. Each of the kings of ancient Nehekhara had many heirs, doubtless the result of their extensive harems, but only one could succeed their father to the throne. This was typically the second son of the king, for the firstborn were given to the gods to serve in the Mortuary Cult. The king's younger sons served as the generals and lieutenants of his armies and enforced his will over his subjects. Upon their deaths they were entombed beside the great tomb chamber of their sovereign, in an eternal council of war, waiting for the moment of awakening when they shall resume command of their Undead legions.</Lore>

The same character may not be nominated by several Tomb Heralds — the oath is a sacred one between a master and his chosen champion. Whenever the nominated character suffers a Wound (before saves are taken) and the Tomb Herald is in the same unit as him, roll a D6. On a 1, the Wound is resolved as normal, but on a 2+ the Wound is intercepted, and re-allocated to the Tomb Herald. No more than one Wound can be re-allocated to each Tomb Herald in each phase. Wounds suffered by a Tomb King or Prince in a challenge can't be re-allocated — it is a duel of honour, and the Tomb Herald may not intefere</Original>

Instead, when the unit shoots, roll an artillery dice for each Sepulchral Stalker in the unit and add the results together. The target suffers a number of automatic hits equal to the result. When rolling To Wound with these hits, substitute the target's Toughness with its Initiative value. If the target has several Initiative values, always use the highest. Targets with no Initiative value are immune to this attack. No armour saves are allowed against a Transmogrifying Gaze. Finally, for each Misfire result rolled, the Sepulchral Stalkers suffer D3 automatic Wounds with no armour saves allowed, as they catch glimpses of their own reflection in their foe's sword blades or polished shields</Original>

				<Lore>The Necrolith Colossus, or Bone Giants as some have called them, are mighty statues of venerated heroes and ancient kings who stride to battle with massive weapons of war, towering over the Undead legions of ancient Nehekhara and the Tomb Kings. Made to resemble immense heroes of old, Necrolith Colossi stand noble and proud. Their forms are covered in skulls, bones and mortuary ornamentation. Indeed, such was Nehekhara's obsession with death and immortality that some Colossi have even been carved to resemble giant skeletons.</Lore>

				<Lore>A Hierotitan is a gigantic animated statue whose face is carved in the likeness of one of the Nehekharan deities of death. These idols radiate a sinister aura of magic, and it is said that those who stand within their shadow can hear the cruel laughter of ancient gods. Hierotitans were constructed to stand within the uppermost chambers of the Tomb Kings' burial pyramids.</Lore>

				Casketa of Souls are mighty magical sarcophagus used by the Tomb Kings to capture and then summon forth the spirits of those that have tried to defile the lands of Nehekhara only to die a horrid and agonising death. At the heart of each tomb of the mightiest kings there lies a casket, sealed with pitch and inscribed with hieroglyphs of malediction and warning. Within this sacred sarcophagus reside the tormented souls of those who have committed the sacrilege of inciting a Tomb King's wrath.

						<Rule>It you have one or more Caskets of Souls on the table at the start of your Magic phase, you add D3 power dice to your pool</Rule>
						<Rule>Bound spell (power level 5). The Casket of Souls can use this spell as long as the Keeper of the Casket model is alive, and the Casket of Souls has not moved this turn. Light of Death is a direct damage spell with a range of 48". The target of Light of Death must take a Leadership test on 3D6, adding the results together. If the test is passed, nothing happens. Otherwise, for each point the unit failed the test by, it suffers an automatic Wound with no armour saves allowed, distributed as for shooting attacks. Once the Leadership test has been resolved, roll a D6: on a 3 or more, choose another unengaged enemy unit within 6" of the initial target — the tortured souls leap to that unit, which must also suffer the effects of the Light of Death spell. Keep rolling for further victims (each within 6" of the last target struck), until the roll is failed or there are no more viable targets. A unit can only be the target of Light of Death once per Magic phase</Rule>
						<Rule>If a Casket of Souls is destroyed, roll a D6 for every unit (friend or foe!) within 12" of the Casket before it is removed from play. On a roll ot 4+, that unit immediately suffers D6 Strength 6 hits, distributed as tor shooting. These are magical attacks, and no armour saves can be taken against them. After resolving the effects of Unleashed Souls, remove the Casket of Souls as normal.</Rule>
