			<Description>The Empire, sometimes referred to as the Empire of Man, is an electoral monarchy composed of feudal states that is the largest and most important of the Human nations in the Old World. It was forged by the warrior-king and ascended deity Sigmar from the primitive tribes of Human barbarians who inhabited what became the lands of the southern Empire more than 2500 years ago.\n\nAlthough not as skilled in craftsmanship as the Dwarfs or in magic as the High Elves, the people of the Empire are not beholden by the limits of tradition to the same extent as those elder races and continue to progress culturally, technologically and magically.\n\nHaving yet to succumb to any threat, external or internal, it is the faith, the sense of righteousness, and the unconquerable spirit of the realm's citizens which gives the Empire its strength, as well as the ruthless efficiency of its military and religious orders</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Runefang</Name>
					<Points>85</Points>
					<NoArmour/>
					<AutoWound/>
					<Lore>At the dawn of the Empire, the Dwarf Runesmith Alaric the Mad forged a dozen magical swords for Sigmar's twelve chieftains as payment Sigmar's help in reclaiming the Dwarven stronghold of Zhufbar from marauding Orcs. Each was a masterpiece, requiring all the skill and ancient knowledge of runecraft to create. The Runefangs are thus blades of unsurpassed power, able to carve through gromril plate and Dragon scale. The Runefangs are traditionally held by the ten Elector Counts of the Empire as treasured heirlooms, passed down from father to son. They are amongst the oldest and most treasured artefacts still surviving in the Old World, and today the Runefangs are synonymous with the status, power and authority of the Elector Counts. Each Runefang is the symbol of office of a particular province and as such, each has its own name and history. When the time comes for a new Emperor to be elected the assembled, the Elector Counts vote by placing their Runefangs at the base of their advocate's personal banner. Of the twelve Runefangs, only ten are currently in the hands of Elector Counts, for the provinces of Solland and Drakwald no longer exist. The Solland Runefang is currently entrusted to the Reiksmarshal of the Empire. The final blade is kept in the Imperial Armoury in Altdorf and occasionally presented by the Emperor to a heroic General who is fighting in the service of the Empire</Lore>
					<Description>All hits from a Runefang wound automatically and allow no armour saves</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>The Mace of Helsturm</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<AddToStrength>10</AddToStrength>
					<AttacksTo>1</AttacksTo>
					<MultiWounds>D3</MultiWounds>
					<HitLast/>
					<Lore>The first Grand Theogonist, Johann Helsturm, used this double-handed mace in battle. It is said that his faith in Sigmar was strong enough to shatter the walls of a castle, and that the mace retains a portion of that holy might to this day. When wielded by a warrior whose devotion is beyond reproach, the head of this weapon burns so brightly it bursts into flame. As the mace is swung overhead, it leaves twin trails of fire in its wake, and when it smashes its foes, it hits with the force of a meteor strike</Lore>
					<Description>Always Strikes Last. Requires Two Hands. The wielder of this weapon strikes at +2 Strength in close combat. Instead of attacking normally, the bearer can choose to forfeit all of his normal Attacks to make a single, special Attack (which still has the Always Strikes Last special rule). If this Attack hits, it is resolved at Strength 10 and has both the Flaming Attacks and Multiple Wounds (D3) special rules</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Armour of Meteoric Iron</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<ArmourTo>1</ArmourTo>
					<AddToWard>6</AddToWard>
					<Lore>Forged from a rare star-metal, it is said that no mortal blade can pierce the Armour of Meteoric Iron. Sword strikes, arrows, and even cannonballs, have all rebounded harmlessly against the Armour of Meteoric Iron, the Twin-Tailed Comet emblazoned on its breastplate not so much as scratched by the blows</Lore>
					<Description>The Armour of Meteoric Iron grants the wearer both a 1+ armour save (that cannot be improved by any means) and a 6+ ward save</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Helm of the Skavenslayer</Name>
					<Points>15</Points>
					<AddToArmour>6</AddToArmour>
					<Fear/>
					<Rule>Causes Terror in all models in a Skaven army</Rule>
					<Lore>The legendary helm of Count Mandred Skavenslayer was crafted from the skull of the Skaven warlord who fell at the Battle of the Howling Hills. Even after Mandred's assassination at the hands of the foul ratmen several decades later, it is said that a portion of his vengeful spirit lived on within the macabre helm, filling those who gaze upon its gruesome visage with fear and dread. Such is its reputation amongst the vile rat-spawn that the mere sight of the Skavenslayer's Helm drives them to frenetic action as they battle their instinctive fear and loathing of the object in equal measure</Lore>
					<Description>Helm. The wearer of the Helm of the Skavenslayer counts his armour save as being one point higher than normal. The wearer also causes Fear. Against models from a Skaven army, the wearer causes Terror instead. However, all Skaven gain the Hatred special rule while attacking the wearer</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>The White Cloak of Ulric</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<SubOpponentToHit>1</SubOpponentToHit>
					<AddToWard>5</AddToWard>
					<Rule>2+ Ward save against Flaming Attacks</Rule>
					<Lore>This cloak is made from the pelt of a ferocious white wolf of Middenland and was blessed by the High Priest of Ulric. The White Cloak is thus imbued with the power of the god of winter and a magical aura of frost protects the wearer, freezing the sword arms of enemies and shielding him from the hottest flames</Lore>
					<Description>Enemies in base contact with the wearer are at -1 to all rolls To Hit. In addition, the wearer has a 5+ ward save, increasing to a 2+ ward save against Wounds caused by Flaming Attacks</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Van Horstmann's Speculum</Name>
					<Points>40</Points>
					<Rule>When the wearer fights in a challenge, he must 'swap' the Strength, Toughness, Initiative and Attacks characteristics on his profile with his enemy</Rule>
					<Lore>Though the Empire's soldiers stand bravely against the dangerous monsters and dark champions that assail them each day, they are no match for these foes on their own. Prior to being corrupted by the Ruinous Powers and his uncovering as a Chaos worshipper, the Wizard Egrimm van Horstmann managed to craft a solution to this problem. The result was a small magical mirror hanged around the wearer's neck with the ability to switch the fighting qualities of the wearer with that of their enemy. Fearing the possibility of being corrupted by van Horstmann's influence, the Light College has since added a series of strong protective wards to the device to limit its power</Lore>
					<Description>When the wearer fights in a challenge, he must 'swap' the Strength, Toughness, Initiative and Attacks characteristics on his profile with his enemy (but not the enemy's mount, if he has one). So, the wearer fights with his enemy's Strength, Toughness, Initiative and Attacks whilst his enemy fights with the wearer's Strength, Toughness, Initiative and Attacks. Note that you cannot choose not to use Van Horstmann's Speculum and you must swap all of the listed characteristics for the duration of the challenge, not just some of them</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Ring of Volans</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Rule>Bound Spell, Power Level variable, one use only: at the beginning of the game, choose one of the eight Lores of Magic</Rule>
					<Lore>Volans was the greatest of the Human pupils of the High Elf Mage Teclis, the founder of the Imperial Colleges of Magic. It was he who instructed the patriarchs of the colleges to commit their newfound knowledge into a single tome so that Teclis' teachings would never be lost. In all the Empire, it is the only source of arcane knowledge that does not distill the secrets of magic into one of its eight separate winds. However, the Human mind is unable to master the full spectrum of sorcery, and every wizard who has attempted to read from the tome has been driven out of their mind. A magical seal was thus placed on the book to protect anyone else from a similar fate, a lock that only Volans' ring can open. This ring has ever since shared a mystical connection to the forbidden tome, and both resonate with raw magical power. A warrior who possesses the Ring of Volans is able, for a small time at least, to harness a tiny fraction of the power of one of the eight Winds of Magic</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. Bound Spell (power level variable). At the beginning of the game, choose one of the eight Lores of Magic from the Warhammer rulebook and generate a spell from it as if the bearer were a Level 1 Wizard. That spell is bound within the Ring of Volans and can lie cast, just like a bound spell, with a power level equal to the normal casting value of the spell</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Griffon Banner</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<Rule>A unit counts double its rank bonus when it comes to working out combat results</Rule>
					<Lore>The Griffon Banner was the personal standard of Magnus the Pious, and ever since the Great War Against Chaos it has been a symbol of noble bravery, sacrifice and valour throughout the Empire. Subtle enchantments are woven into the banner, and when the soldiers of the Empire carry it into battle, they fight with the courage and determination of Magnus himself</Lore>
					<Description>A unit joined by a character bearing the Griffon Banner doubles any combat result bonus granted for having extra ranks. However, a character carrying the Griffon Banner, and his unit, cannot pursue a fleeing enemy and must hold their ground instead</Description>
				</Banner>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Steel Standard</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Rule>The character and his unit ignore any negative Movement penalties for barding</Rule>
					<Rule>Re-roll any dice rolls of a 1 when determining the distance they charge, flee or pursue</Rule>
					<Lore>This glorious standard was created by the first patriarch of the College of Gold Magic. The arcane sigils woven into the fabric of the banner blaze brightly in the presence of metal, altering the heavy, cumbersome armour in which knights and their warhorses are clad, making it lighter than a feather</Lore>
					<Description>The bearer of the Steel Standard and his unit ignore any negative Movement penalties for barding (it they have any), and re-roll any dice rolls of a 1 when determining the distance they charge, flee or pursue</Description>

				<Name>Karl Franz</Name>
				<Points>340</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Lore>Karl Franz, also sometimes styled Karl-Franz or Karl Franz I, Protector of the Empire, Defiler of the Dark, Emperor Himself and the Son of Emperors, Elector Count of Reikland, and prince of Altdorf, is the current emperor of the Empire and the greatest statesman and general the Empire or perhaps the entire Old World has seen in many centuries. Karl Franz, who was elected to the Imperial title in 2502 IC and inherited it from his father, Luitpold I, is acclaimed as a patron of the arts and science, as a military innovator, and as a valiant general. Thanks to his tireless efforts on the behalf of its people, the Empire has flourished during his reign like never before: the Imperial Engineers School in Altdorf has grown, the Colleges of Magic have thrived and his armies have marched from victory to victory, most recently during the terrible events of the Storm of Chaos. The Emperor frequently takes personal command of his troops, wielding Ghal Maraz, the fabled magical warhammer given to Sigmar himself by the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard over two thousand years ago, or his Runefang sword, and riding atop Deathclaw, his Griffon mount of many years.</Lore>

His desire to smite chaos and all its forms drove this Warrior Priest to scorch the land of Beastmen tribes, Chaos cults, and Imperial corruption wherever he goes. Though his deeds were just, his actions have unveiled the corruption from within the Church of Sigmar itself, and it came to pass that an Arch Lector has asked the Grand Theogonist himself to excommunicate this man. Yet the Theogonist was a just man himself, and knew something about Luthor Huss that no one else knows about, and with a smile upon hearing his deeds, he dismisses the ordeal.</Lore>

On many an occasion a rousing speech by a Warrior Priest of Sigmar has restored the troops' faith, brought hope to a seemingly lost cause, or prevented a mutiny when the words of even the most respected commanders had fallen on frightened and angry ears. Warrior Priests of Sigmar normally wear mail or full plate armour underneath their holy vestments, wield the mighty warhammers that are the favoured weapon of Sigmar, and ride into battle atop powerful Imperial warhorses. Among the most commonly employed divine powers of a Warrior Priest are prayers.</Lore>

				<Lore>Demigryph Knights are amongst the most powerful and heavily armored shock calvary within the Imperial arsenal. Not only are these horsemen excellent knights, but they also ride one of the most dangerous and fearsome creatures ever to live within the depths of the Reikwald Forest. A Demigryph is another variant of the Griffon, a creature similar in appearance but somewhat smaller, more numerous and often have no wings for flight. These beasts are only seen in the depths of the Reikwald Forest, which provides more safety for prides of these beast against creatures such as Beastmen or Greenskins living in the more hostile Forest of the North. Thought smaller and flightless, these beasts of war are no less fearsome in their attacks, as a single Demigryph knight can more than hold his own in any battle through the use of the Demigryph's claws and the knight's armored steel.</Lore>

				<Lore>Great Cannons are one of the most common pieces of Imperial artillery, with the Dwarfs and the Empire being the largest producers of gunpowder in the entire Old World. Great Cannons are among the largest of the mobile cannons built and utilised by the Empire. Imperial cannons are made primarily at the Gunnery School of Nuln and it is from here that both the cannons and the crews that operate them come from. Most provinces of the Empire maintain an artillery train and many cities equipped themselves with varying sizes to defend their walls. Larger then other cannons, the Great Cannons can be somewhat unreliable and may misfire, wounding or even killing their crews, but their battlefield value in destroying entire ranks of enemies has ensured its continued service within the Empire warmachine.</Lore>

However due to their insanity, they are often accompanied by a Warrior Priest from the clergy of Sigmar to ensure these men are put on a tight leash.</Lore>

				<Lore>The Helblaster is an experimental artillery piece that was first created within the factories of Nuln by the famous inventor Von Meinkopt, a former engineer of the great School of Engineers. This infamous weapon has the ability to fire multiple cannon balls in a 3 round-burst, with enough strength in it to be able to tear whole regiments of men or beasts into limbs and torsos. However, it is also known for its unreliablity since the weapon regularly malfunctions or even explodes.</Lore>

				<Lore>Steam Tanks are monstrous, smoke-belching creation that rumbles towards the enemy, firing deadly cannonballs to plow through the enemy ranks while charging headlong into battle, protected by extremely thick steel plating. Indeed, these wondrous inventions are powerful and extremely formidable, but they have weaknesses as well. The most glaring weakness is the rarity of these machines: when Leonardo mysteriously disappeared, no one has ever been able to create another one and the secrets for its creation was lost. Leonardo made 12 of the mighty tanks, but as the years went on, some steam tanks were inevitably lost and now only 8 remain. They are also becoming more and more unreliable and less potent than in their earlier years, as it proves difficult to properly repair the machine without Leonardo's guidance. Nevertheless, these machines are dreaded in the battlefield and it is a legendary day to have all 8 of these monstrous beasts in the field at the same time. Some have said that within the foundries of Nuln, ingenious Engineers have begun to learn from Leonardo's scimatics and are as we speak creating a newer generation of Steam-tank to be used in the later wars of the Empire.</Lore>

This Altar emits powerful energies from the Winds of Azyr, giving the wizard controlling it with unrivalled power over the heavens, where lightning bolts and meteorites crash towards their foes below in a hurricane of violence. The Orb of Sorcery that sits at the centre of the construct gathers these energies around it, eventually growing from a steady breeze to a mighty whirling hurricane. Such power is obsessively kept within the Celestial College, and it is rare indeed for these Altars to be deployed in battle.</Lore>

Such is the power and rarity of these constructs that the Light Order is extremely reluctant to send a single one to be used for the benefit of the Empire.</Lore>
