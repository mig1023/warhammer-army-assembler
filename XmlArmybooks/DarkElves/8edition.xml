			<Description>The Dark Elves, or the Druchii as they call themselves in their own tongue, also known as the Naggarothi or the "Dark Ones", are one of the most ancient, powerful, and certainly the most sadistic of the three Elven civilisations of the world.\n\nIn the bleak, chilly lands of the continent of Naggaroth in the New World lies the Dark Elven kingdoms of the Witch King Malekith, a realm born from the depths of malice and hate, a kingdom that seeks nothing more than to despoil a world its people believe loathes their existence. With malevolent eyes, the Dark Elves watch this dying world, knowing it is their birthright to rule all that they survey and those that live upon it are born to do nothing more than to grovel at their feet.\n\nThe Druchii are raiders, slavers and heartless reavers of the first degree, their every whim being nothing more than to sow misery and pain to all that oppose them, for misery and pain is the very lifeblood of their existence. Thus do their Black Arks and Corsair Fleets ply the great waters of the world, raiding and enslaving all before them as a tribute to their own avaricious desires</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Hydra Blade</Name>
					<Points>100</Points>
					<Rule>The wielder of the Hydra Blade has the Random Attacks (D6 + A) special rule, where A is the Attacks characteristic of the wielder</Rule>
					<Lore>The Hydra Blade was carved from a single fang of Akholrak, first and greatest of the War Hydras broken to Malekith's service, and like its many-headed namesake, its keen edge strikes repeatedly against its foes. Though Akholrak is dead now, torn asunder long ago by the talons of the great Caledorian Dragon Incalamir, its malice lives on within this gnarled and twisted sword. Only those of iron will can hope to dominate the Hydra Blade, for it is imbued with an echo of Akholrak's malice and is little inclined to suffer the commands of another. Most wielders discover the blade's willfulness more than offset by its alacrity, but more than a few have perished needlessly in encounters where skill would have served them far better than speed</Lore>
					<Description>The wielder of the Hydra Blade has the Random Attacks (D6 + A) special rule, where A is the Attacks characteristic of the wielder. In addition, at the start of any round of close combat in which the bearer will fight, he must take a Leadership test with a -2 modifier before striking any blows. If the test is passed, nothing extra happens. If the test is failed, the wielder suffers a -5 penalty to Weapon Skill (to a minimum of 1) but gains the Heroic Killing Blow special rule until the end of the round</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Chillblade</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<AutoWound/>
					<Rule>Any model that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds, must immediately pass a Toughness test or suffer -3 to its Attacks characteristic (to a minimum of 1) until the end of the following Close Combat phase</Rule>
					<Lore>When Malekith obliterated the northern citadel of Har Kaldra, he offered neither warning nor quarter. The iron-clad fortress was blasted to rime-scarred splinters with a single cataclysmic spell. Ever after, the freezing north wind has wailed with the agonised voices of those who perished that day, and its chill grasp can be held at bay by neither fur nor flame. It was from scattered shards of Har Kaldra that the Chillblade was forged. Its merest touch freezes not only the physical body, but also the soul within, leaving the victim paralysed and easy prey for his attacker's next strike</Lore>
					<Description>Attacks made with the Chillblade wound automatically. Any model that suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from the Chillblade must immediately pass a Toughness test or suffer -3 to its Attacks characteristic (to a minimum of 1) until die end of the following Close Combat phase</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Black Dragon Egg</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>Strength and Toughness 6, and a Strength 2 Breath Weapon, against which no armour saves can be taken for the rest of that turn, one use only</Rule>
					<Lore>In Ulthuan, the egg of a Dragon is sacred, and harsh punishment awaits any who endanger or disturb a Dragon nest. In Naggaroth, a Dragon egg is naught but a potential source of power, and their nests nothing but cradles to nurture that power. So it is that for every Black Dragon Egg that develops into a hatchling, countless dozens more are taken and consumed, so that their devourers might take a portion of the eggs' strength as their own</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The bearer may consume this item at the start of any player turn. For the rest of that turn, the consumer has Strength and Toughness 6, and a Strength 2 Breath Weapon, against which no armour saves can be taken</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Cloak of Twilight</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>3+ ward save against Wounds caused by shooting attacks and spells</Rule>
					<Rule>Killing Blow in the first round of any close combat</Rule>
					<Rule>Multiple Wounds (D3) in the first round of any close combat</Rule>
					<Lore>Woven from the hair of innocents and dyed with the blood of sorcerers, the Cloak of Twilight is all but invisible to the mortal eye. The cloak has served many masters well along the long centuries. It was this garb that allowed Morathi to keep close watch on the Phoenix Court of Bel Shanaar even from Nagarythe. Centuries later, it had passed from the Hag Sorceress' hands and became the tool that allowed the Master Asassin, Venomblade, to stalk the blood-slicked streets of Tor Elyr as he visited his Night of Screaming Death upon the folk of that great city. Ownership of the Cloak of Twilight guarantees an ambitious Dark Elf the success he craves, but is not without risk. However determined its wearer, there is always a more ruthless pretender, his mind set to steal the cloak's power for his own</Lore>
					<Description>The wearer of the Cloak of Twilight has a 3+ ward save against Wounds caused by shooting attacks and spells. Furthermore, in the first round of any close combat, the wearer of the Cloak of Twilight has both the Killing Blow and Multiple Wounds (D3) special rules</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>The Black Amulet</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<AddToWard>4</AddToWard>
					<Rule>Any successful ward save while fighting in a challenge inflicts one Wound on the bearer's opponent with no Armour saves</Rule>
					<Lore>Carved from the tortured heartstone of a mountain drenched in Dark Magic, the Black Amulet is a lustrous polished stone of midnight hue. It is engraved with a single glowing rune, and into its ebony facets have been poured all the captured malice and spite that emanates from the chill lands of Naggaroth. To behold its darksome shape is to see despair made physical, it is to abandon even the merest memory of hope</Lore>
					<Description>The wearer of the Black Amulet has a 4+ ward save. Furthermore, each time the bearer of the Black Amulet makes a successful ward save while fighting in a challenge, the Black Amulet inflicts one Wound on the bearer's opponent. Armour saves cannot be taken against Wounds d by the Black Amulet</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Ring Of Hotek</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<MagicResistance>3</MagicResistance>
					<Rule>Any enemy Wizard that attempts to cast or target a spell on a unit within 6" of the bearer will suffer a miscast on a roll of double 1, as well as double 6</Rule>
					<Lore>The Ring of Hotek is a magical trinket that not only protects against hostile sorcery, but punishes such casters with a greater chance of miscasting. Hotek was an outcast priest of Vaul. It was he who forged Malekith's rune-etched armour, and oversaw the creation of many of the Witch King's most terrible weapons. Renegade and turncoat though he was, Hotek was no fool. He knew that he lived only at Malekith's fickle pleasure, and so created for himself an armoury of defenses-both magical and mundane-with which he hoped to blunt the Witch King's wrath long enough to escape. Ultimately, Hotek did not perish at Malekith's hand, but was poisoned at Morathi's order. His armoury was broken up soon after, the scattered pieces changing hands with the ebb and flow of patronage and power. None of the artefacts have known as many masters as the Ring of Hotek, for this trinket of obsidian and black diamond is claimed to be the renegade priest's greatest work</Lore>
					<Description>The bearer has the Magic Resistance (3) special rule. In addition, any enemy Wizard that attempts to cast or target a spell on a unit within 6" of the bearer will suffer a miscast on a roll of double 1, as well as double 6. Miscasts caused by a roll of double 1 do not benefit from irresistible force</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of Nagarythe</Name>
					<Points>100</Points>
					<Unbreakable/>
					<Rule>Any enemy Wizard that attempts to cast or target a spell on a unit within 6" of the bearer will suffer a miscast on a roll of double 1, as well as double 6</Rule>
					<Lore>During the Sundering, many of Nagarythe's treasures were lost in battle or destroyed by natural disaster. Those that remained were greedily seized upon by nobles of both allegiances. Some fell into the hands of the Aesanar, who hid them away from Malekith's forces, but the most important were taken by the Dark Elves. The Banner of Nagarythe is the greatest of all such treasures, woven through with silver thread and inlaid with pearls and diamonds. For the Dark Elves, the Banner of Nagarythe is a physical reminder of the injustices heaped upon them by the Phoenix Throne. Moreover, it is the personal standard of the Witch King proclaims his right to rule not only Naggaroth, but the ten kingdoms of Ulthuan as well. For their part, the Shadow Warriors of Nagarythe deem this banner too mired in corruption and betrayal to any longer have any wholesome purpose. They seek not its return, but its destruction</Lore>
					<Description>All models in the unit carrying the banner have the Unbreakable special rule, as do Alith Anar, any Shadow Warriors and any Shadow-walkers (High Elves) if their unit is within 12" of the banner</Description>
				</Banner>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>The Gem of Spite</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Rule>Whenever the bearer suffers a miscast, the Gem of Spite inflicts a single Strength 6 hit on every enemy Wizard within 12"</Rule>
					<Lore>Many Dark Elves feel that a misfortune shared is, if not exactly a misfortune halved, then at least one in which they can take a certain malignant (and posthumous) glee. Such was the goal behind the creation of the Gem of Spite, which inflicts damage on surrounding Wizards when a bearer miscasts. It was fashioned during a rare civil war in Ghrond, when sorceress fought sorceress in an attempt to claim a place at Morathi's right hand. The Gem of Spite still turns up from time to time, normally in the possession of one who has fallen from the Hag Sorceress' favour</Lore>
					<Description>Whenever the bearer suffers a miscast, the Gem of Spite inflicts a single Strength 6 hit on every enemy Wizard within 12". Each time a Wound is caused by the Gem of Spite, your opponent can discard a dice from his dispel pool. If they do so, the Wound is negated and has no effect</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>The Sacrificial Dagger</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Once per casting attempt, after the casting dice are rolled but before a dispel attempt is made, the bearer of this magic item can sacrifice one model in her unit, at 4+ on D6 the Sorceress gains an extra power dice that must be rolled and added to the casting result</Rule>
					<Lore>This dagger is a tiny splinter of the cruel weapon wielded by Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic. It was shivered from her blade during an attempt to sacrifice her sister, Atharti, to an older and darker power than she. The shard was flung far and came to rest in the caverns beneath Ghrond. Here, amongst the bleached bones and rubble, it was discovered by Khaleth the Sorceress. She claimed the dagger as her own and learned how to unlock its power to transmute the soul essence of living creatures into raw and hungry magic. So began Khaleth's rise to the foremost seat of power within the Dark Covenant of Ghrond, an elevation marked by blood sacrifice and the darkest of sorceries</Lore>
					<Description>Once per casting attempt, after the casting dice are rolled but before a dispel attempt is made, the bearer of this magic item can sacrifice one model in her unit. Choose which model is sacrificed — it is immediately removed as a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed — then roll a D6. On a 4+, the Sorceress gains an extra power dice that must be rolled and added to the casting result; dispel attempts can now be made and the spell resolved. On a roll of 3 or less, the sacrifice has not generated enough power — you can either immediately sacrifice another model from the unit and roll again, following the procedure above, or accept the original casting result (if the bearer is the only model remaining in the unit, no further sacrifices can be attempted)</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Tome of Furion</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>When the bearer of the Tome of Furion generates spells from the Lore of Dark Magic, she can choose one spell — the rest must be generated following the normal rules</Rule>
					<Lore>Dark Magic is destruction incarnate - even its most basic precepts are corrosive to the mind, body and soul. Few tomes containing its secrets therefore exist, for mere paper and papyrus smoulder to naught within decades of being inked with such sigils. The Tome of Furion is a rare exception to this rule. Its page are flayed Orc-hide, but the book endures its burdens thanks only to the carefully layered enchantments Furion bound into its covers. The letters inscribed within writhe and shift like living creatures, and the pages are warm to the touch even in the dead of winter</Lore>

				<Description>Malekith, the Witch King of Naggaroth, is the ruler of the Dark Elves or Druchii as they refer to themselves, and the son of the Phoenix King Aenarion, the greatest Elven hero to have ever lived. Malekith is ancient and powerful beyond mortal reckoning, a being who has lived for thousands upon thousands of years, gathering great trove of magical power that few can rival within the world. Long ago, this mighty Lord of the Elven race sought to claim the Isles of Ulthuan by force of will, cruelty and bloodshed, but the Flames of Asuryan denied his right to rule and left him scarred by fire and twisted with hatred.</Description>

				<Description>Crone Hellebron the Blood Queen of Har Ganeth is one of the most ancient of the Hag Queens and second only to Morathi in Khaine's sight. However, while the youth and beauty of Morathi never fades, that of Hellebron is now almost expended, for the Hag Sorceress deliberately withheld from her the deepest secrets of using the Cauldrons of Blood. Therefore, ever more sacrifices are needed to fill Hellebron's cauldron each year, and yet the rejuvenating effects last for less and less time. Once beautiful beyond measure, the Blood Queen must now endure many dark months with the visage of an old and ugly crone for each stolen day of vibrant youth. It is chiefly for this reason that Hellebron hates Morathi, and her wrath at the deception is only deepened by the knowledge that she would have performed the exact same betrayal had their positions been reversed.</Description>

				<Description>Shadowblade, known as the Death that Walks Unseen is the Chief Khainite Assassin of Crone Hellebron. Shadowblade is still relatively young, having known less than two centuries of Malekith's rule. His reputation, however, is legendary, and his arrogance is as bottomless as the sea. Fables of his grisly adventures are already used as stories to scare Dark Elf children, a litany of murder and terror that grows longer and bloodier with each passing day. Shadowblade's most famous exploit was the slaughter of the entire crew of a High Elf Hawkship, one by one, over a period of several days. Only the horribly mutilated captain was left alive, so that he could tell of the mounting horror on the ship as the crew desperately attempted to corner Shadowblade — to no avail.</Description>

				<Description>Sorceresses are the most prominent magic-users of Naggaroth. Elves have a natural affinity for the shifting Winds of Magic. In the ancient days, they learnt the secrets of manipulating this mystical power from the Slann, the most powerful servants of the Old Ones. Yet for all their expertise, there was always a limit to the amount of power the Elves could harness - the risk of madness and spiritual corruption prevented them from delving deeper into the power of Chaos. It was Morathi who first ventured into this forbidden territory. Through dark rituals and bloody sacrifices, she moulded the energies of Chaos to her bidding.</Description>

				<Lore>Black Ark Corsairs are notorious reavers, having spent their entire lives pillaging distant lands. They are the lionised darlings of Naggarothi society, embodying as they do the drive to earn riches and glory. It is a hard, dangerous life in the raiding fleets, but a successful voyage can see a captain and crew return laden down with wealth beyond the dreams of most city-dwellers. It is not uncommon for a Corsair fleet to spend years ransacking foreign lands, returning home only when their holds are bursting with slaves and plunder.</Lore>
