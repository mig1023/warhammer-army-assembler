			<Description>The Ogre Kingdoms are the rightful and sovereign domain of the large and brutish Ogre race. Wandering tribes of Ogres can be found wrecking their way across the globe, erecting many strongholds and plundering far off and exotic lands the likes of which no man will ever see in their lifetime. Yet no matter how far away they may be, all Ogres refer to the scattered tribal kingdoms that dominate the slopes and river valleys of the Mountains of Mourn their rightful, hard-earned homeland. It is here, amongst the frozen peaks and blistering blizzards that mighty Tyrants rule over their own brutal kingdoms, warring amongst each other, looting, extorting and ransacking all before them as a tribute to their own gluttonous appetite and their ever-hungry God, the Great Maw</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Thundermace</Name>
					<Points>55</Points>
					<NoArmour/>
					<MultiWounds Val="D6"/>
					<StrengthTo Val="8"/>
					<Rule>Thundermace single attack</Rule>
					<Lore>A legendary weapon of old, the Thundermace is made from a great hunk taken from an unfeasibly large foundation stone from the base of a skycastle. The great weaponhead is bound with meteoric iron onto a long, stout tree trunk. When brought down over the head, the accumulated force of several tons of masonry explodes outward from the point of impact. It is said that the rumbling aftershocks of a blow from the Thundermace can be heard for miles and there have been several times in its storied history when particularly prodigious blows have started avalanches</Lore>
					<Description>The Thundermace is a two-handed weapon that follows all the rules for great weapons. A Tyrant with the Thundermace may opt to make only one attack per Close Combat phase. On a successful hit (use the highest Weapon Skill amongst the enemy models in base contact to determine whether the Tyrant hits), place the small template anywhere so that it is touching but not overlapping the 'tyrant's base (it may touch friendly models should you so wish, though it does not affect them). Determine casualties exactly as if the unit had suffered a direct hit by a Strength 4(8) stone thrower. In a challenge, a Tyrant choosing to use this special attack does not use a template but instead strikes at Strength 8, doing D6 wounds and ignoring normal Armour Saves</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>The Tenderiser</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<AddToStrength Val="2"/>
					<HitLast/>
					<MultiWounds Val="D3"/>
					<Lore>The Tenderiser is a massive two-ended club made from the axle of a Great Caravan. It is so heavy that even a normal Ogre Bull would struggle to lift it. The destructive power bound into its twin heads enables the bearer to shatter a boulder with one strike</Lore>
					<Description>The Tenderiser is a two-handed weapon that follows all the rules for great weapons. A model wounded by the Tenderiser (after saves, etc) loses not one but D3 wound</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Siegebreaker</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<AddToStrength Val="3"/>
					<HitLast/>
					<MultiWounds Val="D6"/>
					<Rule>When rolling to hit, compare the Ogre's Weapon Skill with the enemy's Initiative value instead his Weapon Skill</Rule>
					<Lore>The origins of the two-handed obsidian club known as Siegebreaker are unknown, but many notorious Ogre Tyrants have famously wielded it down the ages. It is the very weapon Bruto Thundergut used to smash his way into many of the immense mountaintop fortresses of the Skytitans many thousands of years ago. Yet not all of the Siegebreaker's deeds are ancient legend; the leader of the Rockheart tribe smashed through the greenskin blockade of Death Pass, and only a few years ago it was used by Tyrant Lug Boulderhead to turn the Dwarf watchtower atop Ravenpeak into rubble - although Lug was subsequently buried</Lore>
					<Description>Siegebreakeris a two-handed weapon that follows all the rules for great weapons, but adds +3 Strength instead of +2. When rolling to hit, compare the Ogre's Weapon Skill with the enemy's Initiative value instead his Weapon Skill - it is impossible to deflect a blow from the Siegebreaker. Targets without an Initiative character will be hit automatically, and will take D6 wound instead of the usual 1</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Skullplucker</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<KillingBlow/>
					<Lore>Skullplucker is a heavy, spiked metal gauntlet that was originally used by its namesake Big Agi Skullplucker, who had a particular dislike for Elves, and enjoyed nothing more than twisting off their girly little heads with this nasty-looking and bloodstained glove</Lore>
					<Description>The Ogre with this weapon has Killing Blow</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Bloodcleaver</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Every time a Butcher causes an unsaved wound, he may regain one wound he lost earlier in the battle</Rule>
					<Lore>The Bloodcleaver is a revolting, gore-encrusted holy weapon with the vampiric ability to channel the life force from its victims into the Butcher that wields it</Lore>
					<Description>Butchers only. Every time a Butcher causes an unsaved wound with the Bloodcleaver, he may regain one wound he lost earlier in the battle</Description>
				</Weapon>

			<MagicArmours>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Mastodon Armour</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="5"/>
					<Rule>If character is killed by an attack that is not made in close combat, then rolls a dice: on the roll of a 2+ he is return to life with 1 wound at the end of the phase</Rule>
					<Lore>The Mastodon Armour is a great set of plates and chainmail forged by the Chaos Dwarfs in exchange for hundreds of human and Gnoblar slaves. It shifts and hardens in response to incoming attacks</Lore>
					<Description>The Mastodon Armour is heavy armour (5+ Armour Save). If at any point the wielder is killed by an attack that is not made in close combat, then rolls a dice. On the roll of a 2+ he is return to life with 1 wound at the end of the phase</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Greatskull</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="6"/>
					<Rule>Any spellcaster that targets the character or the unit he is with, will miscast on any roll of a double 2 or a double 3 as well as on the roll of a double 1</Rule>
					<Lore>The Greatskull is an ancient, tattooed cave-beast skull, worn as a gut-plate, bleeds hostility and confusion into the minds of any who would do its bearer harm with the arcane arts</Lore>
					<Description>Grants a 6+ Armour Save that can be combined with other equipment normally. Any spellcaster that targets the character with the Greatskull, or the unit he is with, will miscast on any roll of a double 2 or a double 3 as well as on the roll of a double 1</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Bullgut</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="6"/>
					<Rule>Unit Strength as 6</Rule>
					<Rule>Impact hits caused by the Ogre's Bull Charge are considered to be Armour Piercing</Rule>
					<Lore>A Bullgut is a heavy-duty gut-plate with two sharp curving horns that jut out from it, wrenched from the skull of a mighty cave-beast. The ground itself shakes when the bearer makes a bull charge</Lore>
					<Description>The Bullgut confers a 6+ Armour Save that can be combined with other equipment normally. On any turn the bearer charges, he counts his Unit Strength as 6, and any impact hits caused by the Ogre's Bull Charge are considered to be Armour Piercing</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Gut Maw</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="6"/>
					<Rule>If character kills an opponent during a challenge, he may immediately restore a number of wounds equal to the starting Wounds characteristic of the slain opponent, if character is already at full Wounds, then he may add +1 Wound to his profile</Rule>
					<Lore>The Gut Maw is a polished brass gut-plate with a set of huge iron jaws attached to it, blessed by several generations of Butchers and passed through clan to clan. Its jaws can open wide and swallow a foe in battle, and according to Ogres, the victim passes straight through and into the Great Maw itself. There it is consumed and the life force of those ingested by the Gut Maw is passed on to bolster its wearer</Lore>
					<Description>Grants a 6+ Armour Save that can be combined with other equipment normally. If an Ogre wearing the Gut Maw kills an opponent during a challenge, he may immediately restore a number of wounds equal to the starting Wounds characteristic of the slain opponent. If the owner of the Gut Maw is already at full Wounds, then he may add +1 Wound to his profile</Description>

			<Talismans>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Cathayan Jet</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Rule>3+ Ward Save against all wounds caused on him by spells or bound spells</Rule>
					<Lore>Cathayan jet is used to make finely crafted pendants, bowls, rings or other trinkets, which protect their wearers (often, well-travelled Ogres) against all forms of hostile magic, except for High Magic, Dark Magic (both considered sacred and described as Yin and Yang in the East) and Gut Magic</Lore>
					<Description>The character gains a 3+ Ward Save against all wounds caused on him by spells or bound spells, apart from spells chosen from the High and Dark Magic spell lists and wounds incurred from Gut Magic</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Spangleshard</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<Rule>For each individual wound the bearer suffers, roll a D6. If this roll is higher than the result of the To Wound roll, that wound is discounted</Rule>
					<Lore>This was once a finely-wrought gemstone bound into a silver filigree cone, no doubt of Elven origin. Now a dirt-encrusted, chipped remnant of its former glory, the defensive powers of the Spangleshard still activate against powerful attacks</Lore>
					<Description>For each individual wound the bearer suffers, roll a D6. If this roll is higher than the result of the To Wound roll, that wound is discounted. For instance, if the bearer takes a Strength 10 hit and the resultant To Wound roll is a 3, the bearer would have to roll a 4+ to nullify it. This roll is taken before any multiple wounds are caused, and cannot affect automatic wounds</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Wyrdstone necklace</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<AddToWard Val="5"/>
					<Rule>Roll a D6 after deployment, if the result is a 1 the bearer suffers a wound with no saves allowed</Rule>
					<Rule>For each individual wound the bearer suffers, roll a D6. If this roll is higher than the result of the To Wound roll, that wound is discounted</Rule>
					<Lore>Perhaps plucked from the ruins of Mordheim or even from the searing Baleful Deserts around the Great Maw, this shard of Wyrdstone has been bound into a crude necklace where it quietly and silently absorbs its bearer's life force</Lore>
					<Description>The Ogre with this item gains a 5+ Ward Save. Roll a D6 after deployment, if the result is a 1 the bearer suffers a wound with no saves allowed</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Gnoblar Thiefstone</Name>
					<Points>15</Points>
					<Runic Val="1"/>
					<MagicResistance Val="1"/>
					<Lore>Although the tunnels beneath the Mountains of Mourn are dangerous, many Gnoblars risk them in order to search for thiefstones. Strangely enchanted rocks, thiefstones attract magical power, and with a brief pass of a thiefstone over a corpse, any item of any importance will quickly stick to the stone. It is common practice for Ogres who notice Gnoblars with thiefstones to relieve them of their heavy burden. An Ogre might dangle a thiefstone around his neck on a chain or rope or tie one to his weapon shaft, for you never know when such an item will come in handy</Lore>
					<Description>Due to the magical flux generated by this item, the wearer and the unit he is with benefits from Magic Resistance (1). A character may take more than one Thiefstone (to a maximum of three) at 15 points per stone, each additional Thiefstone adds +1 to his Magic Resistance</Description>

				<Arcane>
					<Name>Hellheart</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>One use only: character immediately taking an automatic Strength 3 hit, for the remainder of the phase, any Casting roll that includes a double will result in a Miscast, not just a double 1, any wizard suffering a Miscast must roll on the Gut Magic Miscast table</Rule>
					<Lore>Butchers especially covet the ichor-soaked hearts of Chaos Spawn that were once mighty Chaos Sorcerers. As the fickle powers of the Dark Gods still reside in such foul organs, a Butcher that can swallow a heart whole can, with a single loud and disgusting belch, issue forth a swirling vortex of magical anarchy. Such a maelstrom is not only malodorous, but will also play havoc with any nearby enemy wizards, subjecting their minds to dangerous currents of deadly magic</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The Butcher may use this item at the start of his opponent's Magic phase, immediately taking an automatic Strength 3 hit. For the remainder of the phase, any Casting roll that includes a double will result in a Miscast, not just a double 1. Any wizard suffering a Miscast must roll on the Gut Magic Miscast table instead of his own (he is counted as a Butcher). If a spell is cast with Irresistible Force, resolve the spell as usual and then roll on the Gut Magic Miscast table</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Grut's Sickle</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Rule>After rolling Casting dice for a Gut Magic spell may choose to cause a wound on a unit he has joined in order to gain another Casting dice, which may exceed his normal limit</Rule>
					<Lore>Grut the Bloodthirsty was eventually lynched and eaten by his own tribe, who were riled up when he stole their flesh for use as ritual ingredients. Some of that mighty Butcher's malevolence seems to live on in his now-rusty sickle. Whenever a Butcher with Grut's Sickle joins an Ogre unit, cries of "who did that?", "don't touch me!" and "he's doing it again!" are sure to follow</Lore>
					<Description>After rolling Casting dice for a Gut Magic spell, a Butcher with the Sickle may choose to cause a wound on a unit he has joined in order to gain another Casting dice, which may exceed his normal limit. This extra dice is rolled immediately and added to the casting total. This may cause Irresistible Force or a Miscast as usual, and may only be done once per phase wounds caused by the Sickle may not be allocated to characters, and may not be saved or Regenerated in any way</Description>

					<Name>Halfling Cookbook</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>May re-roll the To Wound dice when he suffers a wound from a successful Bonecruncher or Toothcracker spell, and only suffers a wound from the Trollguts spell on the roll of a 4+</Rule>
					<Lore>The Halfling Cookbook, rumoured once to have belonged to Skrag the Slaughterer, is the lone remnant of the Halfling Wars. Butchers keep it near them when practicing the more unpalatable aspects of Gut Magic</Lore>
					<Description>A Butcher with the Halfling Cookbook may re-roll the To Wound dice when he suffers a wound from a successful Bonecruncher or Toothcracker spell, and only suffers a wound from the Trollguts spell on the roll of a 4+</Description>

					<Rule>Bound spell, Power level 3, Magic missile with a 24" range, causing D6 S4 hits, line of sight may be freely drawn through friendly unengaged Gnoblar units, which will also sustain D6 S4 hits in exactly the same manner as the target</Rule>
					<Lore>Bannaga, the original owner of the Bangstick, was a fiery-tempered and profoundly deaf Butcher that travelled extensively throughout Cathay and Ind. He was famous for the loudness of his voice and his total contempt for the lives of any Gnoblars in the vicinity</Lore>
					<Description>Bound Spell - Power Level 3. The Bangstick may be used once per turn to cast a magic missile with a 24" range, causing D6 S4 hits. Line of sight may be freely drawn through friendly unengaged Gnoblar units, which will also sustain D6 S4 hits in exactly the same manner as the target</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Skullmantle</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<Rule>Any enemy unit forced to take any Leadership tests due to the character or a unit he has joined, suffers a -1 penalty to their Leadership</Rule>
					<Lore>After a significant victory, a Butcher may collect a bagful of heads and boil them all in quicklime. Spending careful hours with the help of a Scalp-Gnoblar or two, he will twist ropes, wood, hair, iron nails and hide into a hideous ritual mask, known as Skullmantle, which is infused with the fears of his defeated foe</Lore>
					<Description>Any enemy unit forced to take any Leadership tests (including Psychology and Break tests) due to the Butcher wearing the Skull mantle, or a unit he has joined, suffers a -1 penalty to their Leadership</Description>

				<Name>Tyrant</Name>
				<Points>200</Points>
				<Description>Ogre Tyrants are the ruthless, tyrannical rulers of the tribal kingdoms that dot the slopes and valleys of the Mountains of Mourn. Ogres call the leaders of their tribes Tyrants and it is easy to see why. Tyrants are the biggest and strongest individuals in a hulking race that prides itself on these physical features. To claim rulership over a group of Ogres requires a mighty brawler, a creature powerful enough to wrestle a Giant to the ground or smash his way through a fortified gate using only his bare fists. An Ogre Tyrant uses his tremendous size and brawn to dominate, earning the right to command the tribe by displaying prodigious feats of what the Ogres respect the most - strength, violence, extraordinary girth and a healthy, all-consuming appetite.</Description>

				<Description>Ogre Bruisers usually act as enforcers or under-chieftains within their tribal kingdom, and they spend a great deal of their time smashing and pummelling in the name of their Tyrant. As a payment for using their fighting skills and brawn, Bruisers have many privileges in the tribe. Not least of these is the license to smack seven shades of dung out of any Ogre not toeing the line, not eating messily enough, or spending too much time playing with his Gnoblars.</Description>

				<Description>Ogre Hunters are solitary, wandering Ogres, outsiders from their own tribe or perhaps even exiles. Those that survive become fiercely independent warriors and savvy stalkers of beasts. Bereft of a tribe's protection and beefy companionship, the lone Hunter must learn to track and kill, while simultaneously not becoming prey to any ferocious beasts - it is all too common for the Hunter to become the hunted.</Description>

				<Description>Ogre Butchers are second only to Tyrants in terms of power and influence, for they not only the spiritual and magical representative of their tribe and god, but they are also the tribe's foremost cooks. Through the gory ritual preparation and consumption of meat, Butchers channel a portion of their fearsome deity's eternal hunger into feats of magic. Invoking the single-minded strength of their god, Butchers can instill unnatural vitality to their comrades, swelling the Ogres muscles and toughening their skin. They can even turn their wrath upon the enemy, causing bones to break or the ground to open up and swallow their foes.</Description>

They go into battle armed with massive two-handed weapons, be they enormous scimitars, rocks bolted to tree boughs with iron bands, or simply gigantic versions of the traditional Ogre club. Ironguts wear large, ornamental gut-plates to show off their elite standing, and cover their meaty arms and boulder-like heads in heavy armour plating cobbled together from various conquests over the years.</Description>

These outgoing but vindictive Gnoblars are the largest and most intrepid of their kind, and delight in catching and torturing the small ferocious mammals that populate the foothills of the Mountains of Mourn. Once they have finished 'playing' with these animals (usually jabbing them with sharp sticks), they either devour them there and then or take them back as an offering to their Ogre masters as a light snack.</Description>

Ogres have long been on the receiving end of artillery fire, and they have grown to respect and admire its tremendous killing power. Indeed such weapons are everything an Ogre admires - they are big, loud and have a tremendous ability to smash things.</Description>

The Yhetee packs inhabit the highest slopes of many mountain ranges, but are particularly common amongst the Mountains of Mourn and, the place of their birth - the towering peaks of the Ancient Giant Holds. There, high on the roof of the world, the Yhetees survive by preying on the beast herds of the highlands.</Description>

It's design is haphazard - the ramshackle construction seemingly built 'on the go' with a random collection of cast off materials. With each stride of its shaggy beast of burden, the jury-rigged device teeters precariously while a frenetic crew of Gnoblars swarm about - running alongside, clambering on its ropes and pulleys like sailors amongst the rigging, or just hanging on for dear life.</Description>
