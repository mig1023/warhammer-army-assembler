			<Description>The Ogre Kingdoms are the rightful and sovereign domain of the large and brutish Ogre race. Wandering tribes of Ogres can be found wrecking their way across the globe, erecting many strongholds and plundering far off and exotic lands the likes of which no man will ever see in their lifetime. Yet no matter how far away they may be, all Ogres refer to the scattered tribal kingdoms that dominate the slopes and river valleys of the Mountains of Mourn their rightful, hard-earned homeland. It is here, amongst the frozen peaks and blistering blizzards that mighty Tyrants rule over their own brutal kingdoms, warring amongst each other, looting, extorting and ransacking all before them as a tribute to their own gluttonous appetite and their ever-hungry God, the Great Maw</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Mawseeker</Name>
					<Points>40</Points>
					<AddToToughness Val="1"/>
					<Stupidity/>
					<Lore>A Mawseeker has completed the pilgrimage to the Great Maw and managed to find his way back. None who have seen the Maw come back unscathed, though, and even those tough enough to survive that deadly trip often return with part of themselves eaten away</Lore>
					<Description>A Tyrant with the Mawseeker name has +1 Toughness on his profile. He also suffers from the Stupidity special rule</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Wallcrusher</Name>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<ImpactHit Val="2"/>
					<Lore>Some Ogres are renowned for feats of brute smashing, such as bludgeoning their way through a skycastle wall using only their own formidable bulk. A Wallcrusher's gut bears many similarities to a boulder - as does his intellec</Lore>
					<Description>Wallcrushers do one additional Impact Hit on a successful Ogre Charge. In addition, Wallcrushers ignore all the effects of obstacles when attacking units that are defending them -he is likely to barge through or smash it down on top of the foe. This does not benefit a unit he joins</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Kineater</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Any friendly unit within 6" may re-roll failed Panic tests</Rule>
					<Lore>Having achieved Tyranthood by killing and eating a member of their own family in a pit fight, Kineaters are considered ruthless even by their own tribe. When fighting alongside a Kineater, it is unwise to flee. After all, it doesn't pay to get on his bad side</Lore>
					<Description>Any friendly unit within 6" of a Kineater may re-roll failed Panic tests</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Mountaineater</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Never be wounded on a score better than a 3+</Rule>
					<Rule>Hits that cause automatic Wounds are unaffected</Rule>
					<Lore>Mountaineaters have dared to scale to the top of a dangerous (and at least partially sentient) mountain. After such a trial, they ritually consume part of the mountain to mark their conquest</Lore>
					<Description>A Mountaineater will never be wounded on a score better than a 3+. For instance, if the Mountaineater was hit by a cannonball (normally wounding him on the roll of a 2+) the cannonball would only wound him on a 3+. Hits that cause automatic Wounds are unaffected</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Giantbreaker</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<AddToStrength Val="1"/>
					<Rule>May never refuse challenges, and neither he nor a unit he is with may choose to flee as a charge reaction</Rule>
					<Lore>An Ogre that has led a Giant Hunt and successfully broken one of the towering brutes in hand-to-hand combat is hailed as a great warrior. Naturally, a Giantbreaker is an extremely strong Ogre and also one that is supremely confident in his own abilities</Lore>
					<Description>A character with the Giantbreaker name has +1 Strength on his profile. He may never refuse challenges, and neither he nor a unit he is with may choose to flee as a charge reaction</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Deathcheater</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<AddToStrength Val="1"/>
					<Rule>Once per game, nominate one model in base contact that has hit the Deathcheater but not yet rolled To Wound: that model must re-roll all successful To Wound rolls this phase</Rule>
					<Lore>An Ogre that has escaped certain doom is seen as being blessed by the Great Maw. How else could an Ogre live through a Rhinox stampede or survive a major avalanche? Not surprisingly, Ogres with the Deathcheater big name tend to have impressive scars</Lore>
					<Description>Once per game, nominate one model in base contact that has hit the Deathcheater but not yet rolled To Wound. That model must re-roll all successful To Wound rolls this phase. This includes all rolls To Wound made by the model's mount, chariot or other extra attacks</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Longstrider</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<AddToMovement Val="1"/>
					<Lore>An Ogre with the big name Longstrider has hunted on the slopes of the mountains for decades, and is even capable of running down a sprinting ice elk. The first Hunter, Jhared the Red, was known as Jhared Longstrider until he slaughtered his own tribe</Lore>
					<Description>A character with the Longstrider big name has +1 Movement on his profile</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Beastkiller</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<Rule>Any attacks against a Large Target gains +1 on his rolls To Wound</Rule>
					<Lore>A Beastkiller has slaughtered an entire pack of cave-beasts or has stalked and slain an especially large and notorious creature. As a sign of his massive accomplishments, the Beastkiller will invariably wear impressive tusks and fangs about his person</Lore>
					<Description>When making attacks against a Large Target (either close combat or shooting), the Beastkiller gains +1 on his rolls To Wound — the Hunter knows just where to strike his prey for maximum effect. If the character is using a magic weapon, then he does not get this bonus</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Brawlerguts</Name>
					<Points>15</Points>
					<Rule>Re-roll failed To Wound rolls from Impact Hits</Rule>
					<Lore>An Ogre with the Brawlerguts big name has earned a reputation for throwing his weight around. Combining brutish strength with a devastating bulk, this Ogre enters combat like an avalanche</Lore>
					<Description>Brawlerguts (but not their mounts) re-roll failed To Wound rolls from their Impact Hits</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Thundermace</Name>
					<Points>85</Points>
					<HitLast/>
					<AddToStrength Val="2"/>
					<Rule>Thundercrush Attack</Rule>
					<Lore>A legendary weapon of old, the Thundermace is made from a great hunk taken from an unfeasibly large foundation stone from the base of a skycastle. The great weaponhead is bound with meteoric iron onto a long, stout tree trunk. When brought down over the head, the accumulated force of several tons of masonry explodes outward from the point of impact. It is said that the rumbling aftershocks of a blow from the Thundermace can be heard for miles and there have been several times in its storied history when particularly prodigious blows have started avalanches</Lore>
					<Description>Always Strikes Last. Requires Two Hands. In close combat, the wielder of the Siegebreaker has +2 Strength. Roll To Hit against the enemy's Initiative instead of his Weapon Skill, and no Parry saves are allowed — it is impossible to deflect a blow from the weapon. In addition, when assaulting models in a building, the wielder can make a 'Siegebreaker Attack' instead of attacking normally in the Close Combat phase (though he may still Stomp). A Siegebreaker Attack inflicts D6 hits with a Strength equal to the height of the building in inches, up to a maximum Strength of 10 (so, for example, models in a building that is 6 inches high would suffer D6 Strength 6 hits). Measure from the base of the building to its highest point</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Siegebreaker</Name>
					<Points>85</Points>
					<HitLast/>
					<AddToStrength Val="2"/>
					<Rule>Siegebreaker Attack</Rule>
					<Lore>The origins of the two-handed obsidian club known as Siegebreaker are unknown, but many notorious Ogre Tyrants have famously wielded it down the ages. It is the very weapon Bruto Thundergut used to smash his way into many of the immense mountaintop fortresses of the Skytitans many thousands of years ago. Yet not all of the Siegebreaker's deeds are ancient legend; the leader of the Rockheart tribe smashed through the greenskin blockade of Death Pass, and only a few years ago it was used by Tyrant Lug Boulderhead to turn the Dwarf watchtower atop Ravenpeak into rubble - although Lug was subsequently buried</Lore>

				<Additional>
					<Name>Gnoblar Thiefstone</Name>
					<Points>45</Points>
					<MagicResistance Val="2"/>
					<Rule>Roll on the table when the model is deployed to see if the Thiefstone has helped them to 'find' any useful items</Rule>
					<Lore>Although the tunnels beneath the Mountains of Mourn are dangerous, many Gnoblars risk them in order to search for thiefstones. Strangely enchanted rocks, thiefstones attract magical power, and with a brief pass of a thiefstone over a corpse, any item of any importance will quickly stick to the stone. It is common practice for Ogres who notice Gnoblars with thiefstones to relieve them of their heavy burden. An Ogre might dangle a thiefstone around his neck on a chain or rope or tie one to his weapon shaft, for you never know when such an item will come in handy</Lore>
					<Description>A Gnoblar Thiefstone grants the bearer Magic Resistance (2). In addition, roll on the following table when the model is deployed to see if the Thiefstone has helped them to 'find' any useful items. Note that this may result in the bearer of the Thiefstone having two Magic Talismans (the Thiefstone and the item from the table). In addition, if the item that has been 'found' is being used by another character (friend or foe), then the other character loses the item — it's been stolen!\n\nD6 Item\n1 Nothing\n2 Luckstone\n3 Talisman of Protection\n4 The Other Trickster's Shard\n5 The Ruby Ring of Ruin\n6 Talisman of Preservation</Description>

					<Name>Greedy Fist</Name>
					<Points>40</Points>
					<AddToStrength Val="1"/>
					<AddToWard Val="6"/>
					<Lore>All Ogres are in awe of the near-sentient gauntlet known as the Greedy Fist. On great occasions, but always after an especially monumental feat of violence occurs in a tribe's maw-pit - such as a spectacular guts-out challenge for Tyranthood or a particularly brutal pit-fight - a strange and wondrous thing has been known to happen. From out of the bones and broken bits that gather in the corners of any maw-pit, crawls a black ironfist, moving on its own, its articulated finger joints pulling it across the bloody ground. With punch-spikes of iron and tusk embedded into the knuckles, the formidable weapon drags itself to a worthy Ogre who may then claim it for a time</Lore>
					<Description>The wearer has 4-1 Strength and a 6+ ward save. If a Magic Weapon inflicts a Wound that is saved by this ward save, its magical properties are consumed by the Greedy Fist; it is treated as a normal, non-magical weapon of the same type for the remainder of the game. If no type is listed, it is treated as a hand weapon. In addition, an enemy Wizard loses a Wizard level and a randomly selected spell each time they are hit by an Ogre wearing the Greedy Fist</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Gut Maw</Name>
					<Points>45</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="5"/>
					<Terror/>
					<Rule>Recovers one lost Wound (up to his starting number) for each unsaved Wound he causes in a challenge</Rule>
					<Lore>The Gut Maw is a polished brass gut-plate with a set of huge iron jaws attached to it, blessed by several generations of Butchers and passed through clan to clan. Its jaws can open wide and swallow a foe in battle, and according to Ogres, the victim passes straight through and into the Great Maw itself. There it is consumed and the life force of those ingested by the Gut Maw is passed on to bolster its wearer</Lore>
					<Description>Heavy Armour. An Ogre wearing the Gut Maw has the Terror special rule. In addition, he recovers one lost Wound (up to his starting number) for each unsaved Wound he causes in a challenge</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Grut's Sickle</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>At the start of the Ogre Magic phase, can inflict a single Wound on any unit he has joined: then he adds +2 to all casting rolls he makes during that Magic phase</Rule>
					<Lore>Grut the Bloodthirsty was eventually lynched and eaten by his own tribe, who were riled up when he stole their flesh for use as ritual ingredients. Some of that mighty Butcher's malevolence seems to live on in his now-rusty sickle. Whenever a Butcher with Grut's Sickle joins an Ogre unit, cries of "who did that?", "don't touch me!" and "he's doing it again!" are sure to follow</Lore>
					<Description>At the start of the Ogre Magic phase, the bearer of Grut's Sickle can inflict a single Wound on any unit he has joined. If he does so, then he adds +2 to all casting rolls he makes during that Magic phase. A Wound inflicted by Grut's Sickle is distributed as a shooting attack, and may not be saved in any way. Roll 2D6 at the end of each Magic phase where Grut's Sickle is used; on a roll of 3 or more nothing happens, but on a roll of double-1 the unit turns upon and slays the wielder of Grut's Sickle, and he is removed as a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Hellheart</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>All enemy Wizards within D6 x 5" of the bearer must roll on the Miscast table, add an extra dispel dice to the Ogre's dispel pool for each enemy Wizard that was forced to roll on the Miscast table, one use only</Rule>
					<Lore>Butchers especially covet the ichor-soaked hearts of Chaos Spawn that were once mighty Chaos Sorcerers. As the fickle powers of the Dark Gods still reside in such foul organs, a Butcher that can swallow a heart whole can, with a single loud and disgusting belch, issue forth a swirling vortex of magical anarchy. Such a maelstrom is not only malodorous, but will also play havoc with any nearby enemy wizards, subjecting their minds to dangerous currents of deadly magic</Lore>
					<Description>One Use Only. The Hellheart can be used at the start of one of the opposing side's Magic phases, immediately after rolling for the Winds of Magic. All enemy Wizards within D6 x 5" of the bearer must roll on the Miscast table. Special rules or magic items that affect a normal miscast roll can be used against miscasts caused by the Hellheart. After resolving all the miscasts, add an extra dispel dice to the Ogre's dispel pool for each enemy Wizard that was forced to roll on the Miscast table</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Rock Eye</Name>
					<Points>5</Points>
					<Rule>At the beginning of each Ogre turn, pick one unit in the line of sight: the opposing player must announce the presence of any hidden models and say what magic items are carried by the unit or any characters that have joined it</Rule>
					<Lore>An Ogre with a Rock Eye has cast one of his own eyes into the Great Maw and replaced it with a rough pebble taken from the parched grounds around the vast pit. So the rock doesn't fall out, an Ogre will choose a large one and hammer it into place. Once properly fitted, the bearer gains a second sight - able to focus his stony gaze and glimpse into the unknown, seeing that which can't be seen</Lore>
					<Description>At the beginning of each Ogre turn, pick one unit in the line of sight of the bearer of the Rock Eye. The opposing player must announce the presence of any hidden models (Fanatics, Assassins and the like) within that unit, and say what magic items are carried by the unit or any characters that have joined it. He need not say who carries them, however</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Rune Maw</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<Rule>When any spell targeting a unit is successfully cast, roll a D6: on 2+ the caster must choose a new target for the spell, if no other target is available, then the spell is wasted</Rule>
					<Lore>Anointed with gore by Butchers, hung with runic items captured from the Dwarfs, and draped with numerous other tribal trophies, a Rune Maw constantly emits a low growl. When the banner detects a magical attack, that rumble rises to a predatory roar and, glowing bright, the banner emits a deafening belch that deflects the magic of the spell, causing it to hit elsewhere</Lore>
					<Description>When any spell targeting a unit with the Rune Maw is successfully cast, roll a D6. On a roll of 2+, the caster must choose a new target for the spell. If no other target is available (because no other target is in range or all eligible units have already been targeted, for example), then the spell is wasted but still counts as having been cast. Spells that do not specifically target the unit are not affected by the Rune Maw</Description>
				</Banner>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Dragonhide Banner</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Reroll>ToHit;ToWound</Reroll>
					<Rule>The bearer of the banner can use Strength 3 Breath Weapon: a unit hit by the icy blast has the Always Strikes Last special rule until the end of its next turn</Rule>
					<Lore>When Greasus Goldtooth slew the ice drake Jaugrel, that great beast's hide was stripped away. It took a full two dozen Ogres to lift that mighty skin and haul it back to the halls of the Overtyrant. Since that day, the vast hide has been cut up and put to many different uses - the most famous of which is the Dragonhide Banner, or just Dragonhide[1a]. Although still reeking from the stench of that decaying wyrm, the banner is said to pass on some of its former owner's legendary ferocity and is wreathed in chill winds. Those that fight beneath it certainly believe in its power and glory</Lore>
					<Description>Models in a unit with the Dragonhide Banner can re-roll all To Hit, To Wound and saving throw rolls of 1 on the turn they make a successful charge. In addition, the bearer of the banner can use it to unleash an icy blast. This is a Strength 3 Breath Weapon. A unit hit by the icy blast has the Always Strikes Last special rule until the end of its next turn</Description>

				<Lore>The most fearsome, largest and powerful Butchers are given the title Slaughtermaster. Slaughtermasters are the chief adepts of the Great Maw and as such they gain access to a greater portion of its food-thirst, projecting the Gut Magic with greater range. As they have commenced many more slaughters, they are much more adept with the sacrificial sickle. Finally, they are even fatter and tougher than those of lesser rank. Being so close to the Ogre deity, they hold more power than even Bruisers.</Lore>

				<Lore>Golgfag's Maneaters, also known as Golgfag's Ogres, are a band of Dogs of War hailing from the arid mountains of the Ogre Kingdoms. This band of mercenaries consists entirely of Ogre Maneaters, lead by their leader and perhaps the most infamous Maneater alive, Golgfag Maneater. For as long as he had lived, Golfag Maneater has lead his brethren into countless battles for riches, glory, and most importantly, food. He has served in the armies of many warlords and generals of many nations, never discriminating on who he is fighting for or against.</Lore>

				<Image>Bragg</Image>
				<Lore>Bragg the Gutsman is an infamous Champion of the Ogre race, and the self-proclaimed executioner of the Ogre Kingdoms. Ogres are a battle-hardened and fearless race, but there walks one amongst their number who is held in dread. Even veterans of a thousand battles feel corpulent shivers at the very name of this killer among killers, this shadowy figure that deals out the most gruesome kind of death imaginable. He is the champion executioner of Ogrekind, a slayer of kings and heroes. To see him on the field of battle is to see death itself at work. He is Bragg the Gutsman, and none he has marked for slaughter have ever survived.\n\nIt is a lonely life - for where Bragg walks, he walks alone, save perhaps the pitter-pattering of a few tagalong Gnoblars. To increase his fell reputation, Bragg has taken to wearing a dark leather hood over his head in the manner of a human hangman, feeling that, since he has such a dreaded aura about him, he may as well capitalise on it.</Lore>

				<Name>Bruiser</Name>
				<Points>105</Points>
				<Lore>Ogre Bruisers usually act as enforcers or under-chieftains within their tribal kingdom, and they spend a great deal of their time smashing and pummeling in the name of their Tyrant. As a payment for using their fighting skills and brawn, Bruisers have many privileges in the tribe. Not least of these is the license to smack seven shades of dung out of any Ogre not toeing the line, not eating messily enough, or spending too much time playing with his Gnoblars.\n\nThis bullying behaviour doesn't make them popular with the rest of the tribe, though most Ogres have learnt that it's better to keep their mouths shut - at least while the Bruiser is within hearing distance, anyway. Occasionally an Ogre will fight back, and in the unlikely event that he wins the resulting brawl, he will be allowed to take the Bruiser's place. This right of challenge serves to keep the Bruisers in line, and ensures that they don't take too much advantage of their privileged position.</Lore>

				<Lore>Ogre Hunters are solitary, wandering Ogres, outsiders from their own tribe or perhaps even exiles. Those that survive become fiercely independent warriors and savvy stalkers of beasts. Bereft of a tribe's protection and beefy companionship, the lone Hunter must learn to track and kill, while simultaneously not becoming prey to any ferocious beasts — it is all too common for the Hunter to become the hunted.\n\nTo ward off the severe cold of high altitude, Hunters dress in layers of skins and pelts and can also be recognised for their tendency to carry an arsenal of weapons, trapping gear, and skinning knives. When one's days are spent stalking Ogre-eating carnivores, it is best to be prepared. Hunters are incredibly proficient with their specialised gear, able to kill beasts on the move even at range.</Lore>

Invoking the single-minded strength of their god, Butchers can instill unnatural vitality to their comrades, swelling their fellow Ogres' muscles and toughening their skin. They can even turn their wrath upon the enemy, causing bones to break or the ground to open up and swallow their foes.</Lore>
