			<Description>The Skaven, sometimes known as the Ratmen, the Ratkin or the Children of the Horned Rat, are a malevolent and diabolical race of large humanoid rat-creatures that inhabit a massive inter-continental underground empire known in their tongue simply as the Under-Empire, where at the very heart of Skavendom lies the horrific city of Skavenblight, the species capital city and the probable birthplace of the Skaven race. The Skaven as a whole are a cruel, treacherous, and highly numerous species that have since spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the Warhammer World. From deep below the earth, these scavengers have built a vast Empire, whose military power and incomprehensible numbers have the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a seething tide of violence and anarchy. It is believed by all of Skaven-kind that the world is destined to be theirs, for they consider themselves the Supreme Master Race, undeniably superior in every way to all the other races of the World</Description>

These troops are only committed into the front when the battle is turning bad for the Skaven, and the need for more hardened warriors is required to ensure victory.</Description>

Standing bigger than the average dog, these rats have a variety of features that only increase their effectiveness in combat, including extra heads, over-sized incisors or claws, spiked tails, and even strong bony armour plates. The far more mutated ones have exposed ribs, massive boils, and even skinless flesh.</Description>

They would also do menial tasks when not in the battlefield, which include labour, mining, tunnelling, or, in dire times, even becoming a reserve food supply for the Skaven army.</Description>

Their rifles, called Jezzails, have the longest range of any rifle in the Old World, due in most part to the dangerous use of warpstone bullets as the main source of ammunition.</Description>

				<Description>The warp-lightning cannon is the very pinnacle of Skaven ingenuity, a marvel of both magical and scientific engineering. This machine has the power to fire a very concentrated blast of pure warp-lightning at the very heart of an army so powerful and potent, that not even castle walls could hold against such an onslaught. When fired, the lightning arcs earthwards towards its victim, and erupts into a cloud of warp-lightning upon impact. The shot flash is too quick to follow, so only its vapour trail can trace the trajectory of the shot.</Description>
