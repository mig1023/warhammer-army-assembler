			<Description>The Skaven, sometimes known as the Ratmen, the Ratkin or the Children of the Horned Rat, are a malevolent and diabolical race of large humanoid rat-creatures that inhabit a massive inter-continental underground empire known in their tongue simply as the Under-Empire, where at the very heart of Skavendom lies the horrific city of Skavenblight, the species capital city and the probable birthplace of the Skaven race. The Skaven as a whole are a cruel, treacherous, and highly numerous species that have since spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the Warhammer World. From deep below the earth, these scavengers have built a vast Empire, whose military power and incomprehensible numbers have the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a seething tide of violence and anarchy. It is believed by all of Skaven-kind that the world is destined to be theirs, for they consider themselves the Supreme Master Race, undeniably superior in every way to all the other races of the World</Description>

Before casting a spell announce which model is eating Warpstone Tokens. For each token consumed, a Wizard can add a single dice to his casting effort. These dice are added to the normal power dice, although this does allow users to roll more dice than is normally allowed by their level. A spell may be cast entirely with warpstone.\nFor any of the warpstone generated dice that rolls a one the Wizard suffers a wound with no armour saves allowed. The results of miscasts or irresistible force apply as normal. When using both normal power dice and Warpstone Token generated dice it is a good idea to roll separately or use dice of a different colour (green-tinged ones work best!)</Description>

The effects of a lifetime's work with warpstone can be seen, as bone spines protrude out of Throt's back and a third arm sprouts out of his bloated but powerful frame.</Description>

				<Description>Gutter Runners are nimble and quick; they would have to be to have survived their apprenticeship in the ranks of Clan Eshin’s Night Runners. They are elite skirmishers and scouts, second only to Eshin’s assassins in the art of stealth and speed. Their attacks are quick and effective, frustrating their enemies as the Gutter Runners appear, attack, and vanish just as quickly in a flash of smoke or a splash of shadow.</Description>

				<Description>The most infamous of Clan Moulder's many creations, these beasts are one of the largest and most fearsome creations at their disposal. Larger than any human, these beasts stand taller than two men, and have enough strength and muscle to fight a whole company of soldiers. A Rat Ogre is to an Ogre what an ordinary Skaven is to a human. Rat Ogres are usually covered with stitches, as many times their Clan Moulder masters have added "modifications" to their already formidable bulk, either adding large saw-like blades, weapon attachments, and even an extra arm to those few Skaven Warlords willing to pay a few extra warp-tokens.</Description>

When they are near the enemy, the Monks will go into a fanatical frenzy, killing their enemy with rusted swords and iron-tipped staffs to infect those they hurt with unimaginable diseases. Due to their diseased bulk, Plague Monks can survive injuries that would normally kill an ordinary Skaven.</Description>

				<Description>A plague censer is a hollow spiked metal ball attached to a lengthy chain meant to be used as a weapon by the Plague Censer-Bearers. Within the hollow spikes are lethal doses of warpstone and vile contagions that release a foul greenish cloud that will cause flesh to erupt into sores and fluid-filled blisters. The Censer-Bearers are fanatical in combat, never faltering or retreating, they continue on their murderous rampage until each and everyone one of them are cut down.</Description>

				<Description> When the need for a more precise shot is required by its Paw-leader, most clans will employ the use of a deadly Warplock Jezzails team to pick off key individuals within an army. Jezzails are a two Skaven team of highly trained snipers employed for the use of assassinating important targets from an extremely long distance. Their rifles, called Jezzails, have the longest range of any rifle in the Old World, due in most part to the dangerous use of warpstone bullets as the main source of ammunition.</Description>

The design of the machine is so simple and yet so complex, so utterly Skaven in its inception that it's well beyond the understanding of even the top minds of the School of Engineers.</Description>

				<Description>The warp-lightning cannon is the very pinnacle of Skaven ingenuity, a marvel of both magical and scientific engineering. This machine has the power to fire a very concentrated blast of pure warp-lightning at the very heart of an army so powerful and potent, that not even castle walls could hold against such an onslaught. When fired, the lightning arcs earthwards towards its victim, and erupts into a cloud of warp-lightning upon impact. The shot flash is too quick to follow, so only its vapour trail can trace the trajectory of the shot.</Description>
