			<Description>The Skaven, sometimes known as the Ratmen, the Ratkin or the Children of the Horned Rat, are a malevolent and diabolical race of large humanoid rat-creatures that inhabit a massive inter-continental underground empire known in their tongue simply as the Under-Empire, where at the very heart of Skavendom lies the horrific city of Skavenblight, the species capital city and the probable birthplace of the Skaven race. The Skaven as a whole are a cruel, treacherous, and highly numerous species that have since spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the Warhammer World. From deep below the earth, these scavengers have built a vast Empire, whose military power and incomprehensible numbers have the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a seething tide of violence and anarchy. It is believed by all of Skaven-kind that the world is destined to be theirs, for they consider themselves the Supreme Master Race, undeniably superior in every way to all the other races of the World</Description>

Before casting a spell announce which model is eating Warpstone Tokens. For each token consumed, a Wizard can add a single dice to his casting effort. These dice are added to the normal power dice, although this does allow users to roll more dice than is normally allowed by their level. A spell may be cast entirely with warpstone.\nFor any of the warpstone generated dice that rolls a one the Wizard suffers a wound with no armour saves allowed. The results of miscasts or irresistible force apply as normal. When using both normal power dice and Warpstone Token generated dice it is a good idea to roll separately or use dice of a different colour (green-tinged ones work best!)</Description>
