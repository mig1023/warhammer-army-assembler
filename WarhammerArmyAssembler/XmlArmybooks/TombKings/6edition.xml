			<Description>The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.\n\nLong ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Destroyer of Eternities</Name>
					<Points>70</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<AddToStrength Val="2"/>
					<KillingBlow/>
					<Lore>The bloodthirsty King Nekhesh first wielded this massive, ornate blade in battle, smashing his foes in all directions and severing limbs and heads with each sweeping blow. The blade destroys the very souls of those it slays, leaving them with no chance of reaching the afterlife. It was thus greatly feared in ancient Nehekhara, where to be killed with it was deemed a fate infinitely worse than death. The sword was also used to ritually execute captured foes of the King. Due to the power imbued through magical incantations, it can cleave through armor, muscle, and bone with ease</Lore>
					<Description>Counts as a great weapon and has the Killing Blow special ability. The player may choose to attack normally with the Destroyer of Kternities or make a special attack. If the special attack is chosen, all enemy models that are touching the Tomb King take two automatic hits. These hits do benefit from the special rules for great weapons and Killing blow. If a target is riding a monster or a chariot, then both take two automatic hits. In a challenge, only the model engaged in the challenge counts as being in contact with the Tomb King</Description>

Each of the kings of ancient Nehekhara had many heirs, doubtless the result of their extensive harems, but only one could succeed their father to the throne. This was typically the second son of the king, for the firstborn were given to the gods to serve in the Mortuary Cult. The king's younger sons served as the generals and lieutenants of his armies and enforced his will over his subjects. Upon their deaths they were entombed beside the great tomb chamber of their sovereign, in an eternal council of war, waiting for the moment of awakening when they shall resume command of their Undead legions.</Description>

				<Description>Liche Priests are the servants of the Mortuary Cult of ancient Nehekhara. Obsessed with both the veneration of the dead and the search for eternal life, the Liche Priests finally discovered a way they could live forever. However, over the millennia of their unnatural lifespans, the Liche Priests' bodies have decayed, forcing them to use embalming techniques and other methods to keep their fragile corpse-like forms in one piece.</Description>

				<Description>The Skeletal Horsemen of the Tomb Kings are the swift and lightning-fast cavalry that has run down the enemies of Nehekhara for millennia. Regiments of Skeleton Horsemen race across the sandy plains of Nehekhara mounted on the fleshless remains of their once-proud steeds, weapons lowered as they gallop towards their foes. These skeletal riders drive their heavy spears into their foes with bone-jarring force, using well-aimed thrusts that punch clean through torsos and rip open throats in a spray of blood.</Description>

Burrowing beneath the surface of the desert, they attack suddenly and without warning, exploding into the fray in a shower of sand. They are lethal foes, for a Tomb Scorpion's tail carries a potent sting that can incapacitate the largest foes, and they have powerful pincers that can slice a man in half.</Description>

Made to resemble immense heroes of old, Necrolith Colossi stand noble and proud. Their forms are covered in skulls, bones and mortuary ornamentation. Indeed, such was Nehekhara's obsession with death and immortality that some Colossi have even been carved to resemble giant skeletons.</Description>
