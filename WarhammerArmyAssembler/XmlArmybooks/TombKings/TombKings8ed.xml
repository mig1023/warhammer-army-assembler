			<Description>The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.\n\nLong ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Destroyer of Eternities</Name>
					<Points>80</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<AddToStrength Val="2"/>
					<HeroicKillingBlow/>
					<Description>Tomb King on foot only. Attacks made with the Destroyer of Eternities are at +2 Strength, and have the Heroic Killing Blow special rule. The wielder can choose to exchange all of his Attacks to make a special 'Sweeping Attack' - if he does so, all enemy models in base contact with the wielder suffer a single automatic hit (also at +2 Strength and with Heroic Killing Blow). If a target is a character riding a chariot or monster, then both the rider and mount each take a single automatic hit. In a challenge, only the models engaged in the challenge count as being in base contact with the Tomb King</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Blade of Antarhak</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Regeneration/>
					<Rule>For every unsaved Wound inflicted by the Blade of Antarhak, the wielder immediately regains a single Wound lost earlier in the battle. If the bearer is already at his starting number of Wounds and inflicts another unsaved Wound with this weapon, he gains the Regeneration special rule until the end of the next player turn</Rule>

					<Name>Golden Death Mask of Kharnut</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<Terror/>
					<Rule>Enemy units within 6" of the wearer cannot make use of their general's Inspiring Presence special rule or their Battle Standard Bearer's Hold Your Ground special rule</Rule>

				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Cloak of The Dunes</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<Rule>Fly</Rule>
					<Description>Infantry character on foot only. The wearer of the Cloak of Dunes has the Fly special rule. In addition, if the bearer moves over an unengaged enemy unit in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, that enemy unit immediately suffers 2D6 Strength 2 hits, resolved as for shooting attacks. The bearer can move over several enemy units in the same turn if you wish, causing damage to every unit. The same target unit cannot be affected more than once in the same turn</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Arcana>
					<Name>Neferra's Scrolls of Mighty Incantations</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>One use only. A Wizard can declare that he is using Neferra's Scrolls of Mighty Incantations immediately before casting a spell. If he does so, the Wizard must add a number of extra bonus dice, equal to his Wizard level, to the power dice he is going to roll (you still need to roll at least one dice from the power pool). The bonus dice do not count as power dice. However, a roll of any double when casting a spell using them will cause irresistible force (and a miscast)</Rule>
				</Arcana>
				<Arcana>
					<Name>Enkhil's Kanopi</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Bound spell (Power Level 3). If cast successfully, roll a D6 for every 'remains in play' spell on the tabletop: on a 2+ that spell is automatically dispelled. For each spell that is ended in this way, add D3 power dice to your power pool</Rule>
				</Arcana>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Standard of The Undying Legion</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>Bound spell (power level 5). This banner contains an augment spell that can only be cast on the bearer's unit. If sucessfully cast, the bearer's unit immediately recovers D6+2 Wounds' worth of models, as described in Resurrecting Fallen Warriors</Rule>
				</Banner>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of The Hidden Dead</Name>
					<Points>90</Points>
					<Rule>Nominate one of your units of infantry, cavalry, or chariots with the Nehekharan Undead rule that has yet to deploy, whose total points value is no greater than 150 points. That unit gains the Entombed Beneath the Sands special rule (see page 29). When this unit arrives on the battlefield you must place its 'Entombed Beneath the Sands' marker within 12" of the Banner of the Hidden Dead. If the bearer of this banner is destroyed before the hidden unit emerges, the entire hidden unit is destroyed and removed as casualties. In addition, every unit with the Entombed Beneath the Sands special rule that attempts to emerge whilst its marker is within 12" of the Banner ot the Hidden Dead (including your nominated hidden unit) can re-roll the scatter and artillery dice when emerging. Note that you must either re-roll both, or neither of the dice</Rule>

Roll To Hit against the highest Weapon Skill amongst the enemy models in base contact. II this Attack hits, place the small template anywhere so that it is touching the Khemrian Warsphinx's base. Any infantry, war beasts or swarm models that lie underneath the template (friend or foe!) suffer a single Strength 3 hit. The model under the template's central hole instead suffers a single Strength 9 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule.

					<Original>Transmogrifying Gaze: This is a shooting attack with range 8" and Strength 1. Does not require a roll To Hit. Instead, when the unit shoots, roll an artillery dice for each Sepulchral Stalker in the unit and add the results together. The target suffers a number of automatic hits equal to the result. When rolling To Wound with these hits, substitute the target's Toughness with its Initiative value. If the target has several Initiative values, always use the highest. Targets with no Initiative value are immune to this attack. No armour saves are allowed against a Transmogrifying Gaze. Finally, for each Misfire result rolled, the Sepulchral Stalkers suffer D3 automatic Wounds with no armour saves allowed, as they catch glimpses of their own reflection in their foe's sword blades or polished shields</Original>

						<Rule>It you have one or more Caskets of Souls on the table at the start of your Magic phase, you add D3 power dice to your pool</Rule>
						<Rule>Bound spell (power level 5). The Casket of Souls can use this spell as long as the Keeper of the Casket model is alive, and the Casket of Souls has not moved this turn. Light of Death is a direct damage spell with a range of 48". The target of Light of Death must take a Leadership test on 3D6, adding the results together. If the test is passed, nothing happens. Otherwise, for each point the unit failed the test by, it suffers an automatic Wound with no armour saves allowed, distributed as for shooting attacks. Once the Leadership test has been resolved, roll a D6: on a 3 or more, choose another unengaged enemy unit within 6" of the initial target — the tortured souls leap to that unit, which must also suffer the effects of the Light of Death spell. Keep rolling for further victims (each within 6" of the last target struck), until the roll is failed or there are no more viable targets. A unit can only be the target of Light of Death once per Magic phase</Rule>
						<Rule>If a Casket of Souls is destroyed, roll a D6 for every unit (friend or foe!) within 12" of the Casket before it is removed from play. On a roll ot 4+, that unit immediately suffers D6 Strength 6 hits, distributed as tor shooting. These are magical attacks, and no armour saves can be taken against them. After resolving the effects of Unleashed Souls, remove the Casket of Souls as normal.</Rule>
