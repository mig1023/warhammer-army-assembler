		<Description>The Tomb Kings, known as the Priest Kings in their former lives, are the undying rulers of Nehekhara, an ancient Human civilisation that formed a great and powerful empire some two thousand five hundred years before the birth of Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Out of all the unliving creatures that would claim dominion and royalty over the dead, only the Tomb Kings could truly claim such masterful and undisputed sovereignty. For they had once ruled a mighty and far-flung empire during a time when the rest of Mankind were little more than savage barbarians.||Long ago, during an ancient and forgotten age, Nehekhara stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and Human achievement; a golden age when its cities shone with a majestic splendour, its buildings crafted from magnificent marble and limestone, its armies capable of conquering entire kingdoms. In this long-lost age, Nehekhara's mighty rulers reigned as living gods amongst men. But this great realm was destroyed millennia ago through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished long ago in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.</Description>

The enemy wizard can resist the spell's effects by rolling equal to or under his wizard level on a D6. If he fails, an amphibian transformation takes hold and he becomes a small, slimy toad! Whilst transformed, the wizard cannot channel or cast spells, all of his magic items and mundane equipment (armour, weapons, etc.) temporarily stop working and all of his characteristics are reduced to 1 (except for his wounds, which are unaffected). His controlling player can roll a D6 at the start of each of his subsequent magic phases; the spell dissipates on a roll of 4+ and the wizard returns to his normal form (but still attempts to eat flies for several days afterward).</Description>

					<SpecialRule>If you have any Tomb Kings or Tomb Princes in your army, you must nominate one of them for the Tomb Herald to protect at the start of the game. The same character may not be nominated by several Tomb Heralds — the oath is a sacred one between a master and his chosen champion. Whenever the nominated character suffers a Wound (before saves are taken) and the Tomb Herald is in the same unit as him, roll a D6. On a 1, the Wound is resolved as normal, but on a 2+ the Wound is intercepted, and re-allocated to the Tomb Herald. No more than one Wound can be re-allocated to each Tomb Herald in each phase. Wounds suffered by a Tomb King or Prince in a challenge can't be re-allocated — it is a duel of honour, and the Tomb Herald may not intefere</SpecialRule>

Roll To Hit against the highest Weapon Skill amongst the enemy models in base contact. II this Attack hits, place the small template anywhere so that it is touching the Khemrian Warsphinx's base. Any infantry, war beasts or swarm models that lie underneath the template (friend or foe!) suffer a single Strength 3 hit. The model under the template's central hole instead suffers a single Strength 9 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. Other troop types underneath the template are too big to be crushed, and don't suffer any hits</SpecialRule>

					<SpecialRule>Transmogrifying Gaze: This is a shooting attack with range 8" and Strength 1. Does not require a roll To Hit. Instead, when the unit shoots, roll an artillery dice for each Sepulchral Stalker in the unit and add the results together. The target suffers a number of automatic hits equal to the result. When rolling To Wound with these hits, substitute the target's Toughness with its Initiative value. If the target has several Initiative values, always use the highest. Targets with no Initiative value are immune to this attack. No armour saves are allowed against a Transmogrifying Gaze. Finally, for each Misfire result rolled, the Sepulchral Stalkers suffer D3 automatic Wounds with no armour saves allowed, as they catch glimpses of their own reflection in their foe's sword blades or polished shields</SpecialRule>

					<SpecialRule>It you have one or more Caskets of Souls on the table at the start of your Magic phase, you add D3 power dice to your pool</SpecialRule>
					<SpecialRule>Bound spell (power level 5). The Casket of Souls can use this spell as long as the Keeper of the Casket model is alive, and the Casket of Souls has not moved this turn. Light of Death is a direct damage spell with a range of 48". The target of Light of Death must take a Leadership test on 3D6, adding the results together. If the test is passed, nothing happens. Otherwise, for each point the unit failed the test by, it suffers an automatic Wound with no armour saves allowed, distributed as for shooting attacks. Once the Leadership test has been resolved, roll a D6: on a 3 or more, choose another unengaged enemy unit within 6" of the initial target — the tortured souls leap to that unit, which must also suffer the effects of the Light of Death spell. Keep rolling for further victims (each within 6" of the last target struck), until the roll is failed or there are no more viable targets. A unit can only be the target of Light of Death once per Magic phase</SpecialRule>
					<SpecialRule>If a Casket of Souls is destroyed, roll a D6 for every unit (friend or foe!) within 12" of the Casket before it is removed from play. On a roll ot 4 + , that unit immediately suffers D6 Strength 6 hits, distributed as tor shooting. These are magical attacks, and no armour saves can be taken against them. After resolving the effects of Unleashed Souls, remove the Casket of Souls as normal.</SpecialRule>
