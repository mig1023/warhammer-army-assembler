			<Description>The Dwarfs, also called the "Elder Race" (or the Dawi as they call themselves) are one of the oldest and proudest intelligent races of the Warhammer World, with a great wealth of history and power that stretches back to time immemorial. They once held an empire which stretched from Norsca in the north to the jungles in the south, and from Mount Silverspear in the east to the Grey Mountains in the west. But the heart of the Dwarfen realm, the Karaz Ankor as they call it, will always lie within the domains of the Worlds Edge Mountains. The highest mountain range in the world, it is filled with the magnificent halls and holds of the Dwarfen people - a testament to the great feats of engineering and power once wielded by this ancient civilization</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>The Hammer of Karak Drazh</Name>
					<Points>65</Points>
					<AddToInitiative Val="4"/>
					<Rule>Enemy that suffer one or more unsaved Wounds have their own Initiative reduced to 1 until the end of the Close Combat phase</Rule>
					<Lore>The Runelords of Karak Drazh wrought wonders the likes of which had never been seen before, or since, but even amongst their treasure hoards, there was one hammer that stood out as exceptional. It was struck with runes so that it could be swung with preternatural ease, yet it hit with a bludgeoning force — its blows sending shock waves emanating outwards in ripples of concussive force. The weapon was feared lost forever with the fall of Karak Drazh, yet thousands of years later, it has again been recovered</Lore>
					<Description>Attacks with the Hammer of Karak Drazh are resolved at +3 Initiative, and any enemy models that suffer one or more unsaved Wounds from it have their own Initiative reduced to 1 until the end of the Close Combat phase</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Red Axe of Karak Eight Peaks</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Terror/>
					<Reroll>ToHit;ToWound</Reroll>
					<Lore>This axe was forged in Karak Eight Peaks by the mad Runesmith Orrey Singebeard. Struck with unique runes of vengeance and cooled in the poisoned wells of that ruined hold, the Red Axe shines with a crimson sheen. Skaven recognise the fabled axe blade — calling it the Red Death and squealing in their scurrying panic to flee. The Night Goblins also loathe the axe, typically losing control of their bowels in their haste to run away from its bearer</Lore>
					<Description>The Red Axe of Karak Eight Peaks allows its wielder to re-roll To Hit and To Wound rolls against all models from Orcs, Goblins or Skaven. Additionally, the wielder also has the Terror special rule against all Orcs, Goblins or Skaven</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Magnificent Armour of Borek Beetlebrow</Name>
					<Points>60</Points>
					<ArmourTo Val="2"/>
					<Rule>3+ Ward save against all attacks of Strength 6+</Rule>
					<Lore>A pair of massive Giants plundered the lands around Karak Hirn, displaying an all-too understandable thirst for Dwarf-made ale. They ate so many Miners that Karak Hirn’s forges grew cold for want of materials to work with. Many attempted to slay the Giants, yet all failed in their task. Desperate, King Olfast promised the Runelord Borek Beetlebrow the pick of his own treasures if the fabled smith would forge something to rid the land of Giants. Who knows what runes were struck upon that gromril suit or what alloys were smelted into its silversteel, yet the armour was proof against the Giants’ blows. Borek was victorious, and to the horror of King Olfast, he chose the King’s lone daughter — Heldred the Uncommonly Smooth, as his reward, but that’s another tale</Lore>
					<Description>The Magnificent Armour of Borek Beetlebrow grants the wearer a 2+ armour save. In addition, the Armour of Borek Beetlebrow grants the bearer a 3+ ward save against all attacks of Strength 6 or higher</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Silver Horn of Vengeance</Name>
					<Points>45</Points>
					<Rule>One use only: at the start of any friendly turn any friendly units within 6", has the Devastating Charge special rule until the start of their following turn, cause Fear in all High Elves, Dark Elves or Wood Elves for the rest of the game</Rule>
					<Lore>After the War of Vengeance, High King Gotrek Starbreaker ordered the Dwarf Runesmiths to melt down the silver helms of the slain foe. Most of this went as wergild to the families of Dwarfs who fell, but a hunting horn, too, was fashioned from that silver — a gift, it is said, for the King of Karak Varn, who lost his brother in the Battle of Three Towers. When winded, the horn sounds a clear note that can be heard for miles. It brings vigour to troops on the same side, but for foes, it foreshadows certain doom. Those few Elves who have heard the Silver Horn of Vengeance and lived claim that they can still hear it echoing deep inside their own minds</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The Silver Horn of Vengeance can be used at the start of any friendly turn. Its wielder, and any friendly units within 6", has the Devastating Charge special rule until the start of their following turn. Additionally, once used, the blower of the Silver Horn of Vengeance, and any unit he joins, cause Fear in all models from Warhammer: High Elves, Dark Elves and/or Wood Elves for the rest of the game</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Fiery Ring of Thori</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Rule>Strength 4 Breath Weapon with the Flaming Attacks special rule</Rule>
					<Lore>The Fiery Ring of Thori is set with a dark ruby of great size and splendour. Within its heart flickers a mysterious flame, entrapped there in ages past by a masterful Runesmith. When its runes are activated, they glow with eldritch power, causing a sheet of flame to spring directly in front of its wearer, its blazing fury as red hot as the grudges of the Dwarf who forged the ring so many ages ago</Lore>
					<Description>The Fiery Ring ofThori gives its bearer a Strength 4 Breath Weapon with the Flaming Attacks special rule</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of Lost Holds</Name>
					<Points>100</Points>
					<Reroll>ToWound</Reroll>
					<Lore>After the Goblin Wars, and the fall of some ofthe most fabled Dwarf holds, the High King Kurgan Ironbeard ordered a special banner constructed. Its making was unusual — many Runelords whose holds had been destroyed worked together, even though the master craftsmen typically guard their secrets with jealous fervour. By combining their skills, they constructed the Banner of Lost Holds. Upon it can be seen the marks of Karak Drazh, the symbol of Karak Varn, the ancestral icons of Karak Ungor and a dozen of the lesser Dwarf holds lost through the ages. Kept in Karaz-a-Karak in the High King’s Hall, the Banner of Lost Holds is gifted to throngs in times of war so that the flames of vengeance might be rekindled once more into searing hot revenge. The Dwarfs will never forget and never forgive. To fight beneath this storied banner is to recall the fury of so many wrongs done to their race</Lore>
					<Description>All models in a unit that carries the Banner of Lost Holds can re-roll failed To Wound rolls in close combat</Description>

Since that time, Belegar has dedicated his life to reclaiming Karak Eight Peaks. He proclaimed himself King and fortified his position, encamping his forces into the wreckage of the once-mighty surface structures of Karak Eight Peaks. There he remains, defiant and in a constant state of siege. From out of this slender foothold, the Dwarfs launch forays into the depths, bloody offensives intent on breaking their opponents' seemingly limitless armies, recapturing lower halls or seeking out lost treasures.</Description>

				<Description>Dwarf Lords are those Thanes who have been promoted to lead a dwarf throng into battle as the supreme commander. When a Dwarf King sends an army to defeat the enemies of the dwarf race, defend his hold, or to send missions and expeditions, the King appoints several clans and their extended families to answer the call of battle. Among the Thanes of every clan who were given the task, they will appoint one of their number to be the helm. Each of these dwarfs must not only be a capable warrior but also a leader, a tactician, credible, and have the longest beard outside of the greybeards. The lord's level of equipment depends on his clan's standing; wealthy clan thanes wear suits of gromril Armour, the strongest Armour known to dwarf kind, and use powerful rune weapons, while poorer clan thanes use iron armour and a potent rune weapon. Most dwarf throngs are led by those from the royal clan, related to the king, these dwarfs hold the actual title of "lord" but Thanes more often than not will become or rather take the role of "lord" if need be.</Description>

These survivors, more convinced than ever that the Ancestor Gods have denied them the release of death, choose to follow in Grimnir's footsteps. They go to the far north, to the Chaos Wastes, and embark upon the path of the Daemon Slayer. At this point, most Slayers now believe that their inability to find honourable death has an entirely deeper meaning: Grimnir has found them worthy to help him close the warp gate.</Description>

This is really saying something, for Dwarfs take their ale seriously, and there are many famous brews and renowned brewers, yet still, the name of Bugman stands as a paragon of quality. A member of the Dragonback Clan, after the fall of Ekrund, Josef’s relatives set up a stout brewhouse in the foothills of the Grey Mountains. A moderate success, the brewery took off after Josef took over, with triumphs like Bugman’s XXXXXX and the notorious Troll Brew. Set at the height of his ales' growing popularity, disaster struck. While returning from a delivery, Bugman arrived at his brewery to find it a smouldering ruin.</Description>

				<Description>Runesmiths are the closest thing Dwarfs have to magic users in their culture. Runesmiths learn the ancient crafts of working metal and magic into Runes of power. The oldest and most respected of them are the Runemasters. The Runesmiths are members of the Guild of Runesmiths, which is said to have its origins in the days of the Ancestor God Grungni. The Guild claims descent from his son Morgrim, and it is for this reason they sometimes refer to themselves as the "Clan of Morgrim", though they are not the only clan who claim descent from the mighty god. All Runesmiths are kin, although the relation is often somewhat remote. Each family hands down its craft through the generations. When a Runesmith feels that the time is right, he will take one of his young relatives as an apprentice, teaching him all he knows about the art of Rune making. However, Runesmiths are so protective of their knowledge that many of them fail to find a worthy successor, and end up taking their art with them to the grave. The Guild of Runesmiths has great respect in their society. At the very least a Runesmith will have endured hundreds of years of harsh tutelage from their masters, and older Runemsiths will have centuries of runecraft and gathering of lost secrets reflected in the length of their beards and their tough, cantankerous demeanour.</Description>

It will easily beat the goblin's weak bows, and it is even capable of dropping a heavily armoured Black Orc dead in its track. The number of Dwarfs that use crossbow has fallen some in recent time as more and more started taking up handguns, but the crossbow will never disappear entirely. The Quarrellers that remain are a stubborn bunch, preferring to trust their own eyes over those new-fangled sights. If nothing else, many begrudge the cost of gunpowder when all a crossbow takes is a little bit of elbow grease and a determined eye.</Description>

				<Description>Although some more old fashion or traditional dwarfs still regard the handgun with some suspicion, it has become a common sight, almost as common as the crossbow. The Dwarfs who specialise themselves in using the handgun have become known as Thunderers. Being methodical as well as mechanically gifted, they will simply keep on loading and firing in a disciplined manner, even when the enemy is right up close, rarely suffering the misfires that would afflict less-disciplined troops. Many Thunderers will have crafted their own handguns, incorporating personal preferences and additional improvements of their own. There are a lot of rivalries between Thunderers as to who has the most accurate handgun, which has resulted in the Dwarf handguns being the most precise weapons of their kind in the world.</Description>

These ensure that they receive the proper respect from other Dwarfs, who have been taught quite rightly to always respect their elders. Longbeards have fought in more wars, beaten more enemies, and endured greater hardships than any young Dwarf could possibly imagine. They constantly grumble about how today's Goblins are far smaller and weaker than they used to be, and how nothing is as well made as it was in their day. No young Dwarf would dare argue with them, for they indeed have the experience and the beard to prove it. In battle, Longbeards are able to demonstrate their time-won skills, showing disdain for even the smallest shifts in fortune that would throw less experienced warriors into confusion. Forming into their own regiments, these are considered the veterans within a Dwarf army.</Description>

				<Description>When a Dwarf hold goes to war, many mining clans will send their warriors to battle. As a gesture of pride in their profession, they will tend to carry picks rather than axes, but such is their skill with them that this is no disadvantage. There are many benefits to having such troops in an army, notably, they can use their skills to tunnel beneath the enemy and gain the advantage of surprise. Equipped with deadly explosives, these Dwarfs can be devastating when fighting a formation of enemy troops.</Description>

				<Description>Slayers seek death in combat in order to atone for some wrongdoing. Although they seek death, Dwarfs are incapable of deliberately fighting to lose, and so always enter the fray to win. Therefore Slayers spend as much time as possible for improving their warrior skills. Slayers deliberately seek uneven combat, for example by entering a Goblin stronghold alone. Trolls are considered the ideal opponents, as the Dwarf's death is almost assured. Their way of life weeds out all but the toughest and most determined warriors so that those Slayers who survive for any period time are invariably exceptionally tough, violent, and extremely dangerous.</Description>

					<Original>An Organ Gun has the following profile and special rules: Range 30", Strength 5 and Armour Piercing. To fire the Organ Gun, select a target according to the normal rules for shooting, then roll two artillery dice to find out how many shots are fired. If one of the dice rolls a misfire, the firing mechanism is not working properly or it suffers a minor jam. All shots fired from the Organ Gun this turn suffer a -1 To Hit. If both dice roll a misfire, no shots are fired and a critical fault has occurred; roll a D6 and consult the Black Powder War Machine Misfire. The number of shots fired by the Organ Gun is equal to the total of both artillery dice. After determining the number of shots, roll that number of dice To Hit the target using the crew's Ballistic Skill and applying all appropriate modifiers. However, the Organ Gun never suffers a To Hit penalty for firing multiple shots</Original>

Roll the artillery dice and extend the fine away from the Cannon the number of inches shown - this is where the teardrop-shaped template is placed.

				<Description>Rangers are Dwarfs who serve as scouts and hunters to a Dwarf Karak. Rangers spend most of their time on the surface to keep constant vigil over the Karak's borders, hunt game, and map the land, eventually becoming a Dwarf King's eyes and ears to the events that happen in the outside world. Dwarfs are a mountain race and expert miners, and as such the common dwarf will treat a ranger with suspicion and distrust. Rangers are considered the first line of defence, holding the enemy back by harassing them with hit and run tactics using well-placed traps and bolt fire until an allied army arrives.</Description>
