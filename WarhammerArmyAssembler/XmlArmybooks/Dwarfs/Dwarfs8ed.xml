			<Description>The Dwarfs, also called the "Elder Race" (or the Dawi as they call themselves) are one of the oldest and proudest intelligent races of the Warhammer World, with a great wealth of history and power that stretches back to time immemorial. They once held an empire which stretched from Norsca in the north to the jungles in the south, and from Mount Silverspear in the east to the Grey Mountains in the west. But the heart of the Dwarfen realm, the Karaz Ankor as they call it, will always lie within the domains of the Worlds Edge Mountains. The highest mountain range in the world, it is filled with the magnificent halls and holds of the Dwarfen people - a testament to the great feats of engineering and power once wielded by this ancient civilization</Description>

					<Original>An Organ Gun has the following profile and special rules: Range 30", Strength 5 and Armour Piercing. To fire the Organ Gun, select a target according to the normal rules for shooting, then roll two artillery dice to find out how many shots are fired. If one of the dice rolls a misfire, the firing mechanism is not working properly or it suffers a minor jam. All shots fired from the Organ Gun this turn suffer a -1 To Hit. If both dice roll a misfire, no shots are fired and a critical fault has occurred; roll a D6 and consult the Black Powder War Machine Misfire. The number of shots fired by the Organ Gun is equal to the total of both artillery dice. After determining the number of shots, roll that number of dice To Hit the target using the crew's Ballistic Skill and applying all appropriate modifiers. However, the Organ Gun never suffers a To Hit penalty for firing multiple shots</Original>

					<Original>Flame Cannons shoot using the fire thrower rules with special rules: Range 12", Strength 5, Flaming Attacks, Multiple Wounds (D3). To fire the supercharged flame shot, nominate a point within the war machine's line of sight and within 12". Place a small counter in the correct position, uUsing your tape measure, extend a 'shot' line from the Cannon's barrel all the way to your target point. Roll the artillery dice and extend the fine away from the Cannon the number of inches shown - this is where the teardrop-shaped template is placed. After this, work out hits exactly as per normal fire thrower rules. If you roll a misfire result while shooting a supercharged flame shot, you suffer a -1 penalty on the Black Powder War Machine Misfire chart</Original>
