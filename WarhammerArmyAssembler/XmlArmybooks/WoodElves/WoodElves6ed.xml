		<Description>The Wood Elves, known as the Asrai in some tales, or as the Fay Folk of Athel Loren, are a reclusive, secretive and highly isolationist race of Elves that have long ago voluntarily split off from the rest of their kin, preferring instead to live out their lives in Nature's embrace beneath the enchanted forested canopy of Athel Loren. However, other conclaves are known to exist, such as the Eonir of Laurelorn.\n\nFrom these mystical realms, the Wood Elves have learnt to dwell in concord with the seasons and the weave of life and death that binds all living things together. They are the defenders of the forest, guardians of all things natural and pure. For millennia, the Wood Elves have lived in this state of harmony, lying in wait and hidden from the prying eyes of the wider World.</Description>
