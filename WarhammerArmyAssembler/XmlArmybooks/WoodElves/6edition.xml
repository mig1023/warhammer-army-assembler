			<Description>The Wood Elves, known as the Asrai in some tales, or as the Fay Folk of Athel Loren, are a reclusive, secretive and highly isolationist race of Elves that have long ago voluntarily split off from the rest of their kin, preferring instead to live out their lives in Nature's embrace beneath the enchanted forested canopy of Athel Loren. However, other conclaves are known to exist, such as the Eonir of Laurelorn.\n\nFrom these mystical realms, the Wood Elves have learnt to dwell in concord with the seasons and the weave of life and death that binds all living things together. They are the defenders of the forest, guardians of all things natural and pure. For millennia, the Wood Elves have lived in this state of harmony, lying in wait and hidden from the prying eyes of the wider World</Description>

					<Name>A Blight of Terrors</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Terror/>
					<Lore>Terrors are malicious spites that dwell in the dark places of Achel Loren. They delight in terrifying unsuspecting intruders into Athel Loren. They take great mirth in the horrified and frightened expressions of their prey, and even greater hilarity if their target dies of shock. They often hide secreted on a host, and when that host comes near an enemy, they loom out, screaming and wailing, taking on their most fearsome aspect</Lore>

					<Lore>Spites are vicious manifestations that take countless varied forms. Some have barbed, thorn-like limbs and razor sharp talons, others take the form of diminutive winged figures armed with tiny weapons. Some seem to be all teeth and talons, while others may hide their viciousness behind a façade of innocence and beauty. They hide within the cloaks of their hosts, or within the cracks and hollows of ancient Treemen, peeping out maliciously and ready to attack any who draw near</Lore>
					<Description>The model gains +D6 attacks in close combat. These are worked out at the bearer's WS, and have an Initiative of 4 and a Strength of 2. In addition, these attacks count as magical, and are Poisoned Attacks</Description>

					<Lore>Malevolents appear in countless guises and are aggressive defenders of Athel Loren, utilising poisoned darts and needle-like arrows, known as Elf-shot to the Bretonnians, to bring down their enemies.

A model with Malevolents may stand and shoot with them (in addition to any other ranged weapon the model may have), even if the charging unit is outside the model's line of sightfer. it would not normally be allowed to stand and shoot because the enemy is within half its' charge range. So long as the model has a chance to be contacted by the enemy unit, the character may still stand and shoot</Description>

Some say they are able to reach within the bodies of their foes to attack vital organs and the mind, causing great pain and sometimes death</Lore>

				<Name>Orion</Name>
				<Points>575</Points>
				<Character/>
				<Description>The immortal Consort King of Athel Loren, Orion is the rampaging avatar of the elf god Kurnous. He is a terrifying sight to behold, standing over ten feet tall and his green skin ripples with muscle. Although he must die each winter, he is reborn each spring, and reaches the peak of his power in mid-summer. Such is the way of things, the "continuation of the never-ending process of death and rebirth". Orion is normally accompanied by his baying hounds and the Wild Riders of Kurnous. Orion counts as both a Lord and a Hero choice. At the height of his power in midsummer, Orion is a terrifying being of majesty and power. And his lithe, green-tinged body ripples with barely contained anger. As the moons align overhead on midsummer's eve, a beautiful cloak crafted by his Queen is draped over his shoulders, and the great horn of the Wild Hunt is placed reverently before him. As the time of the conjunction draws near, he takes up his weapons from their shrine within the Oak of Ages. At midnight, Athel Loren goes utterly silent – not a creature stirs – for all know that the ride of the Wild Hunt has come.</Description>

The Asrai believe she was driven mad when the blood of the powerful beastman Morghur was spilled in her glade, though in truth, she was malevolent and capricious long before that. She hates all who enter into Athel Loren, and blames the Wood Elves for all the evils that threaten the enchanted forest. In recent years, she and the forest creatures that serve her have taken to attacking villages around Athel Loren, leaving no survivors and showing no mercy. Drycha is believed to have entered the service of Coeddil, a tree-man whose hatred of the Asrai is legendary, and it is rumoured that she is forming a resistance to exterminate the Asrai.</Description>

Most notably, the kindreds include the "Alters" who are characters that have been changed by the forest. They take on the aspects of the creatures of the forest, through which they move as rapidly as cavalry, and when they come upon the intruder they visit it with a torrent of attacks.</Description>

				<Name>Treemen</Name>
				<Points>285</Points>
				<Description>Treemen are the most powerful spirits in Athel Loren. They, unlike Tree Kin, are permanently bound to a living tree, making a connection that only death can sever. Also, Treemen are ancient beings - some are old beyond mortal reckoning- of gigantic size and have many abilities that Tree Kin do not. One example is the mystical power of tree-singing, which can enable trees to walk or attack nearby enemies.</Description>

				<Description>A Great Eagle is just that — an eagle of epic proportions. They live in the Grey Mountains, or on the very highest treetops of Athel Loren and have a special connection with elves. Wood elves use eagles as deadly flying monsters. Some heroes of the Wood Elf race are even known to ride them to battle.</Description>
