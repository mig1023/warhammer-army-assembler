			<Description>The High Elves, or the Asur, as they call themselves, are one of the most ancient and powerful mortal civilisations within the Warhammer World. Hailing from a mighty mist-shrouded island-continent located within the centre of the Great Ocean, the High Elves of Ulthuan are a proud and mighty nation of masterful warriors, peerless mages and lords of the sky and sea. They are an ancient race with powerful armies and even grander magic, building a grand and all-mighty civilisation who, alongside the Dwarfs, fought a long-forgotten, apocalyptic war which saw some of the greatest and most powerful mortal heroes battle against the great darkness that tried to consume the world many thousands of years ago. At the zenith of their power, the world was truly theirs for the taking</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Blade of Leaping Gold</Name>
					<Points>70</Points>
					<AddToAttacks Val="3"/>
					<Rule>Any roll of 6 To Wound ignores armour saves</Rule>
					<Lore>A more finely balanced sword than this was never made. With this sword, Alcandor of Cothique singlehandedly held the gates of Tor Estara for seven days. Mentheus, right hand of Morvael the Impetuous, wielded it until his death upon the walls of Anlec, having spilled more Dark Elf blood than any other since the time of Tethlis the Slayer. An ordinary blade would be dulled by such a roster of endless war, but this sword has never lost its edge. To the valiant, it lends supernatural speed and vigour; to the craven and corrupt, it brings only swift death</Lore>
					<Description>The Blade of Leaping Gold grants the wielder +3 Attacks. In addition, any roll of 6 To Wound made with the Blade of Leaping Gold ignores armour saves</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Star Lance</Name>
					<Only>Mount</Only>
					<Points>30</Points>
					<ChargeStrengthBonus Val="3"/>
					<Rule>Armour saves cannot be taken on the turn he charges</Rule>
					<Lore>The Star Lance was created at the command of Aenarion the Defender and gifted to the nobles of Caledor for their unfailing courage. Forged from the metal of a fallen star, this weapon's graceful lines belie the formidable power it grants its wielder. Since the days of its making, the Star Lance has seen battle in the service of every Phoenix King, carried to war each time by a trueblood hero of Caledorian descent. Legend has it that the Star Lance strikes with the wrath of a mighty Star Dragon, and cannot be unmade whilst the fires of Vaul's Anvil still smoulder</Lore>
					<Description>Mounted character only. The Star Lance can only be used in a turn in which the bearer makes a successful charge. Attacks with the Star Lance are resolved at +3 Strength, and armour saves cannot be taken against Wounds caused by the Star Lance. If the bearer did not make a successful charge this turn, or if his mount has been slain, he must instead fight using another weapon</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Reaver bow</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Longbow with range 30", +1 Strength, Volley Fire and Multiple Shots(3)</Rule>
					<Lore>Imollar was a noble of Ellyrion, and a marksman of considerable note. It was said that his arrows could fly true through stormy winds and still find their mark, even he took but a moment to aim. Upon hearing this, Prince Arathion, himself a skilled archer – and one burdened by a surfeit of pride – challenged Imollar to an archery contest, staking as prize a most fabulous weapon from his own collection – the Reaver Bow. So it was nobles from across Ulthuan bore witness to a contest of skill not to be seen again for generations. As the final arrow found its mark, Imollar was crowned as the greatest archer of all, and Arathion discovered humility – along with the folly of staking his family's treasured heirlooms as wagers in a contest of pride</Lore>
				</Weapon>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Armour of Caledor</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<ArmourTo Val="2"/>
					<AddToWard Val="6"/>
					<Rule>Fireborn</Rule>
					<Lore>This armour is the heirloom of the house of Caledor, the greatest of all the Dragon Princes. For well over four thousand years the masters of the house of Caledor has worn this armour in battle. It is a suit of Ithilmar, unsurpassed in its beauty, lightweight and flexible, and yet stronger than any armour made of mortal steel. However, the Armour of Caledor is not a single suit. Rather, it is an amalgam of components gathered across the millennia. Every piece of the Armour of Caledor has been taken from the recovered fragments of now-lost armour that was once worn by a mighty Caledorian hero. The gorget, for example, was worn by Caledor the Conqueror during the War of Blood Gorge, whilst the left vambrace belonged to Maldrik Firesworn, Saviour of the Silver Isles. The chestplate still bears the scars earned when it preserved Alkar Dragonhelm from the poisoned daggers of the Khainite Assassin Master, Halkir Venomheart. There are many more such tales, for every scale and plate has earned its place in Elven history many times over. When a noble of Caledor dons this armour, his resolve and fortune are redoubled. Some say this is merely a noble heart rising to the challenge of his forebears, but others claim it is nothing less than the power of the ancestors themselves flowing through him</Lore>
					<Description>The Armour of Caledor grants the wearer a 2+ Armour save that cannot be improved by any means. In addition, the Armour of Caledor grants the bearer a 6+ Ward save and the Fireborn special ride</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Armour>
					<Name>Shadow Armour</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<AddToArmour Val="5"/>
					<Scout/>
					<Rule>Strider</Rule>
					<Lore>The Shadow Armour was crafted with skills now lost to the High Elves. Some believe it was forged in the hidden camps of Shadow Warriors, whilst others hint it is not of Elf make at all, but a gift from Loec, the trickster god. The shimmering armour weighs almost nothing and exists somewhere between the real world and that of magic, allowing its wearer to pass all but unseen by mortal eyes. The first to don it was Prince Temakador, one of the handful of nobles who saw Aethis' reign for the folly it was and fought a bitter campaign of ambush and sabotage against the Dark Elves as the Phoenix Court descended into complacency. Many times did Aethis' agents seek Temakador's arrest, but each time he was thought cornered, he melded into the darkness and slipped away</Lore>
					<Description>Model on foot only. The wearer of the Shadow Armour has a 5+ Armour save. In addition, the wearer has both the Scouts and Strider special rules</Description>
				</Armour>
				<Shield>
					<Name>Shield of the Merwyrm</Name>
					<Points>15</Points>
					<AddToArmour Val="6"/>
					<Rule>Parry save of 4+</Rule>
					<Lore>In the murky deeps far below Lothern's Emerald Gate slumbers Amanar, ancient protector of the city. Only in hours of greatest need does the merwyrm rouse and rise to the surface to consume those who would bring about Lothern's ruin. The records kept in the Glittering Tower tell that Amanar has manifested but three times in recorded history. The first was during the Daemon invasion, where he swallowed whole a legion that laid siege to the city. The second came during the Sundering, where his broad back held Lothern high above the tidal waves that swamped Ulthuan. The third, and to date final, appearance of Amanar came during the Great Incursion. With a great sweep of his tail, he scattered much of the Dark Elf army; then, ignoring the pinpricks of their blades, he turned and bore the Black Ark Intolerable Delight beneath the waves, never to be seen again. No sight has there been of Amanar since that day, but a single great scale was recovered after the battle was done, which now forms the unbreakable heart of this shield</Lore>
					<Description>Shield. Unless he is fighting with a weapon that has the Requires Two Hands special rule, the bearer of the Shield of the Merwyrm has a parry save of 4+ (even if he's fighting with a magic weapon)</Description>
				</Shield>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Golden Crown of Atrazar</Name>
					<Points>10</Points>
					<WardForFirstWound Val="2"/>
					<Lore>This golden circlet, studded with rare and magical gems, radiates an aura that protects its wearer from harm. No mere gemstones are set about this circlet, but brilliantly polished shards taken from waystones all across Ulthuan. Thus can the bearer of the Golden Crown draw upon the magics of the Great Vortex to guard himself from harm. Few wear the Golden Crown for long, however, for the spirits of the dead hang heavy about its brow, and their whispered praises and encouragements would inflate the wearer's pride to epic proportions, driving even the noblest mortal into a dangerous, self-obsessing madness</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. The Golden Crown of Atrazar bestows a 2+ Ward save against the first wounding hit suffered by the wearer (which cancels out not only the Wound, but also any Killing Blow or Multiple Wounds special rules the attack has) after which its power fades and it cannot be used again during the game</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Moranion's Wayshard</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Only>Infantry</Only>
					<Rule>Ambushers</Rule>
					<Lore>In the days of his youth, Moranion – of Athel Tamarha – wandered the realm of Yvresse as one of its Mistwalkers. Few could tread the fog-wreathed paths as surely as he, for he bore a wayshard attuned to the great watchstone at the realm's heart. Thus did Moranion walk the Daemon-haunted mists as easily as he would have done under clear skies, leading ambushes of spear and bow to destroy the invaders. Though Moranion now sleeps eternally, his wayshard still glimmers with power. Those who can unlock its secrets will never again find themselves lost, no matter how far they might stray</Lore>
					<Description>Model on foot only. The bearer of Moranion's Wayshard has the Ambushers special rule. He can also give the Ambushers special rule to a friendly Archers or Spearmen unit, up to 30 models in size and chosen from Warhammer: High Elves, immediately before deployment. If he does so, he immediately joins the unit and cannot leave it until the turn after the one in which the combined unit has deployed</Description>

				<Additional>
					<Name>Khaine's Ring of Fury</Name>
					<Points>25</Points>
					<Rule>Bound spell, Power level 3, Soul Quench spell</Rule>
					<Lore>he Elves are justly famed for their magical rings, and the black iron Ring of Fury, is one of the most feared. Khaine once had eight rings, or so the legends tell. Hekarti, Goddess of Magic, designed each of them to embody a single Wind of Magic. Vaul, the Godsmith, wrought them with all his cunning, binding to each a glittering gemstone that shone with the power of the winds. Khaine was much pleased with these gifts, for they gave him a mastery of magic which he had never before known. Yet the Lord of Murder was not to keep his prizes for long. Neither Hekarti nor Vaul had any love for Khaine, and had fashioned the rings out of fear of reprisal, rather than for filial duty; moreover they worried for how the godly balance of power would be altered by what they had done.\n\nThus did Hekarti and Vaul, whose love for each other could have filled only the very meanest of vessels, then conspire together to see Khaine divested. So did they tell Atharti, the Lady of Desire and most covetous of all the divine host, of Khaine's new treasures, hoping that she would distract the Lord of Murder long enough for the rings to be reclaimed. Atharti immediately resolved to take the rings for her own, but Khaine would not part with them, no matter what seductive wiles she brought to bear. Eventually, they came to blows and, in the process, the rings were lost. To the great dismay of all who sought them, the rings had fallen into the mortal world, where Asuryan's law forbade the gods from treading. Over the centuries that followed, only one ring has been found, the black iron Ring of Fury. It has been brought to the battlefield only at times of greatest need, for no one wields the power of the gods lightly. Fewer still find it wise to so openly taunt the Lord of Murder with his loss</Lore>
					<Description>Bound spell (power level 3). Khaine's Ring of Fury contains the Soul Quench spell (see the Lore of High Magic)</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Gem Ofsunfire</Name>
					<Points>20</Points>
					<Rule>Once per battle, all of the bearer's spells, shooting attacks and close combat attacks have a +1 bonus To Wound and Flaming Attacks special rule</Rule>
					<Lore>Bound within this brilliant jewel is the angry essence of Angranir, greatest of the Flamespyre Phoenixes. During the civil war, Angranir was struck down by sorceries meant for Caledor, and neither priestess of Isha nor learned physician could heal him. So it was that Aeldamar, High Mage of Tiranoc, was instructed to save the Phoenix's spirit, so that the noble bird's light could bring hope to Ulthuan for long years to come. Alas, by then, all that remained of Angranir was a burning brand of magic which, while formidable of temperament, now lacked any of the firebird's intelligence or majesty. Nonetheless, Aeldamar did as he was bid, and preserved the enchanted flame within a many faceted topaz. Mindless still, Angranir's fire lends its heat to the fires wielded by the bearer</Lore>
					<Description>One use only. During the turn in which the Gem of Sunfire is used, all of the bearer's spells, shooting attacks and close combat attacks (and his mount's, if he has one) have a +1 bonus To Wound (rolls of 1 still fail) provided that they also have the Flaming Attacks special rule</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Additional>
					<Name>Cloak of Beards</Name>
					<Points>10</Points>
					<Fear/>
					<Rule>Against Dwarfs causes Terror</Rule>
					<Rule>All Dwarfs gain the Hatred special rule while attacking the model</Rule>
					<Lore>For millennia the High Elves have fought bitterly against the Dwarfs, collecting beards as a token payment for their black theft of the Phoenix Crown and weaving them into a cloak that mocks and scorns the Dwarfs with its existence. To many High Elves, the Cloak of Beards is a relic of an unhappy hour. But, for a few, notably those whose ancestors fought in Caledor's final battle against Gotrek Starbreaker, it is a valued reminder of the perfidiousness of Dwarfs. This latter group ensure that the Cloak of Beards is never lost: indeed, with every generation, it grows longer and more fulsome, as more beards are seized and woven into its folds. Now, its power is such that its mere presence subverts prideful Dwarfen works. Such is the enmity focussed in this item that Dwarf runes, the pride of their race, are drained of their power if they come too close</Lore>
					<Description>The wearer of the Cloak of Beards causes Fear. Against models chosen from Warhammer: Dwarfs, the wearer causes Terror instead. However, all models from Warhammer: Dwarfs gain the Hatred special rule while attacking the wearer. In addition, at the start of each Close Combat phase, roll a D6 for each magic item carried by each model from Warhammer: Dwarfs that is in base contact with the bearer. On a roll of 4+, that magic item is destroyed and cannot be used for the rest of the batde. Note that this has no effect on magic items that are mounts, magic items that contain bound spells that have already miscast during the game, and any magic items labelled as 'one use only' that have already been used during the game — do not roll to see if these magic items are destroyed</Description>
				</Additional>
				<Arcane>
					<Name>Book of Hoeth</Name>
					<Points>55</Points>
					<Rule>May re-roll a single dice from each of his casting or dispel attempts</Rule>
					<Lore>The Book of Hoeth is one of Saphery's most treasured artefacts. This well-worn tome has been studied by mages throughout the ages and has helped some of the greatest understand the inner workings of the realm of magic. The very first pages are laid down in the hand of Bel-Korhadris himself; and every subsequent entry bears the seal of the greatest Loremaster of his time. Yet a great many of the Book of Hoeth's pages remain blank: the scholars of the White Tower are aware that even their knowledge has limits, boundaries that must be driven back if complete mastery of magic is to be achieved</Lore>
					<Description>The Book of Hoeth allows the bearer to re-roll a single dice from each of his casting or dispel attempts. Results of 6 cannot be re-rolled</Description>
				</Arcane>
				<Banner>
					<Name>Banner of the World Dragon</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<Rule>2+ Ward save against all Wounds caused by spells, magic weapons and magical attacks</Rule>
					<Rule>All Dragons within 12" have the Stubborn special rule</Rule>
					<Description>All models in a unit that carries the Banner of the World Dragon have a 2+ Ward save against all Wounds caused by spells, magic weapons and magical attacks. Furthermore, all Dragons (friend or foe) within 12" of the Banner of the World Dragon have the Stubborn special rule</Description>

				<Description>Prince Tyrion, Heir of Aenarion, Champion of the Everqueen, and Defender of Ulthuan is the greatest living High Elven warrior of this age. So valiant and skilled is he that the bards of Ulthuan sing that he is nothing less then Aenarion reborn — a tale that is given credence far beyond Ulthuan's shores. Since Tyrion's meteoric rise to fame, many have whispered of his destiny to lead the High Elves towards a glorious future, and perhaps one day to take the Phoenix Crown. If Tyrion hears such gossip, he pays it no heed, for he is unswervingly loyal to Finubar. Thus does Tyrion concern himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen, the beloved Alarielle.</Description>

It was Eltharion who was the first of Ulthuan's generals to dare an assault on Naggarond itself and live to speak of it, and he who finally brought about the defeat of Waaagh! Grom. For his valour in that battle, Eltharion was elected Warden of Tor Yvresse and, though he is a dour ruler, the people of that fair city love him dearly.</Description>

				<Description>The High Elven Princes of Ulthuan are the greatest and most skillful generals, strategist and warriors this world will ever see. Depending on their wealth and the kingdom of their birth, the princes of Ulthuan fight in many different ways. Those of Tiranoc typically do battle from the back of swift-wheeled chariots, while the lords of Lothern often stand, spear and bow in hand, amidst the ranks of the Sea Guard. Those with the greatest wealth might ride upon a Great Eagle or Griffon or, in the case of the mightiest princes of Caledor, upon a Dragon. Such steeds are invariably a symbol of status, as well as lending a brutal advantage in the midst of battle.</Description>

On his forehead was the glowing rune of Asuryan, marking him as the servant of the Creator God. On that day, Caradryan gave up all his worldly possessions and took the vow of the Phoenix Guard.

As a result of Phoenix King Morvael's introduction of the levy system, over a thousand years ago the majority of Ulthuan's armies are composed of citizen militia. This system made it so all Elves receive military training, whether it be a craftsman, tradesman or artist, they all must fight in defense of Ulthuan in times of war.</Description>

				<Description>The Lothern Sea Guard are the specialised citizen-militia of the Kingdom of Eataine, fighting as effectively on land as at sea, and are equally resolute when defending the walls and fields of Lothern as they are when battling on the deck of a ship. These dangerous duties require the Sea Guard to maintain a flexible armoury. The vast majority are well-trained in the use of spear, shield and bow — the better to combine the finest aspects of the spear and archer regiments of other cities and realms. Indeed, it is a point of pride in Lothern that the discipline of their warriors far surpasses that of any found elsewhere in Ulthuan.</Description>

				<Description>The Silver Helms are seen as the perfect exemplars of mounted martial grace and valor to which young Elves should aspire. Dragon Princes are too distant and aloof, Ellyrian Reavers perhaps a touch too wild and uncivilized; Silver Helms are proud without being haughty, and brave without being undisciplined. Thus, Ulthuan's legends more often center around the deeds of its Silver Helms than any other warriors within the ten realms.</Description>

				<Description>The Ellyrian Reavers, or Reaver Knights, are a famous formation of elite Ellyrian horsemen who are famous for their abilities as swift and agile horse archers. In the time of Caledor I, all Ulthuan was in turmoil and the armies of Malekith roamed freely, destroying and slaying at will. With his armies already stretched to the limit, the Phoenix King called for brave young horsemen to ride the troubled land.</Description>

				<Description>Lion Chariots are the mighty mounts of the Chracian White Lions. Not all white lions are killed out of hand. The High Elves take no joy in needless slaughter, and often stay their blades should cubs be discovered. These infants would doubtless become savage and deadly beasts if they were left in the wild, but with expert care, the young white lions are raised to become as loyal as Griffons. These 'tame' white lions swiftly form a bond with the Chracian hunters that foster them and later serve the armies of Ulthuan as War Lions.</Description>

				<Description>The White Lions have served as the personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First. Whilst hunting in Chrace, Caledor received news that he was to be next Phoenix King. He immediately took the road to the Shrine of Asuryan, but was intercepted by Dark Elf Assassins. He would surely have died, but for the intervention of a party of Chracian woodsmen who swept out of the forest to defend him. The Chracians slew the Dark Elves and, thereafter, saw Caledor safely to the Phoenix Shrine, employing every iota of their woodcraft to avoid further Dark Elf ambushes that lay in their path. Caledor's first act, once crowned as Phoenix King, was to form the Chracians into an official bodyguard based in Lothern.</Description>

It is even said that highest masters of the order can slay a foe with but a touch, or kill with a single precisely-pitched whistle. When Ulthuan marches to war, none go more eagerly than the Swordmasters of Hoeth, for only in war can they truly unleash the full extent of their deadly art. As the Swordmasters advance, their blades blur and weave, knocking aside arrows in mid-flight and leaving trails of bloody spray wherever Hoeth-forged steel tastes flesh.</Description>

The Shadow Warriors are masters of ambush and guerrilla warfare, elite warriors even among other Elves. They strike swiftly and noiselessly from concealment with deadly accurate volleys from their longbows, before charging forth to slay any survivors with a flurry of blades. At some point, every race has felt the wrath of the Shadow Warrior, for they go before the armies of the Asur wherever they fight, slaughtering the enemy's scouts and clearing a path for the main force.</Description>

Legend tells that any who behold the wall shall forever be cursed with knowledge of their own death. The Phoenix Guard do not utter a word. It is forbidden for those who have seen the secrets of time to speak of them, and all who do so take a magical vow of silence from which they can never be released.</Description>

				<Description>The Dragon Princes of Caledor are amongst the greatest and most noble Knights the world has ever known. Long ago, Ulthuan was dominated by the valorous deeds and wise rule of Caledor's Dragon Princes. Now, the royal bloodline has faded, and the power of the Dragons has diminished, but Caledor's pride still shines bright. The princes of Caledor once rode Dragons, but today they ride to war upon swift horses. Both mount and rider wear crested ithilmar armour whose style echoes that of the heart of Vaul's Anvil, where ancient enchantments are bound into the cooling ithilmar, ensuring that no lesser flame than the fires of Vaul can offer harm to the armour or its wearer.</Description>

These serve as the eyes and ears of Lothern's fleets, allowing them to plan engagements long before the enemy is even aware of their presence.</Description>

Only when the enemy is sufficiently weakened do the Tiranoc Charioteers crash into the press of melee in a glorious massed charged, the steeds biting and kicking, the riders thrusting their spears into the black hearts of their foes.</Description>
