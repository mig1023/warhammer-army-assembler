			<Description>The High Elves, or the Asur, as they call themselves, are one of the most ancient and powerful mortal civilisations within the Warhammer World. Hailing from a mighty mist-shrouded island-continent located within the centre of the Great Ocean, the High Elves of Ulthuan are a proud and mighty nation of masterful warriors, peerless mages and lords of the sky and sea. They are an ancient race with powerful armies and even grander magic, building a grand and all-mighty civilisation who, alongside the Dwarfs, fought a long-forgotten, apocalyptic war which saw some of the greatest and most powerful mortal heroes battle against the great darkness that tried to consume the world many thousands of years ago. At the zenith of their power, the world was truly theirs for the taking</Description>

				<Character/>
				<Description>Prince Tyrion, Heir of Aenarion, Champion of the Everqueen, and Defender of Ulthuan is the greatest living High Elven warrior of this age. So valiant and skilled is he that the bards of Ulthuan sing that he is nothing less then Aenarion reborn — a tale that is given credence far beyond Ulthuan's shores. Since Tyrion's meteoric rise to fame, many have whispered of his destiny to lead the High Elves towards a glorious future, and perhaps one day to take the Phoenix Crown. If Tyrion hears such gossip, he pays it no heed, for he is unswervingly loyal to Finubar. Thus does Tyrion concern himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen, the beloved Alarielle.</Description>

Being of the line of Aenarion, each of his descendants are destined for greatness amongst the Ten Kingdoms. This has made Tyrion a masterful warrior and general, and in turn, this greatness makes Teclis one of the most powerful living mages in the world.</Description>

				<Description>Eltharion the Grim, Prince of Yvresse and Warden of Tor Yvresse, is one of the greatest of all Elven lords. Many times has he achieved what would have been thought impossible. It was Eltharion who was the first of Ulthuan's generals to dare an assault on Naggarond itself and live to speak of it, and he who finally brought about the defeat of Waaagh! Grom. For his valour in that battle, Eltharion was elected Warden of Tor Yvresse and, though he is a dour ruler, the people of that fair city love him dearly.</Description>

				<Description>The High Elven Princes of Ulthuan are the greatest and most skillful generals, strategist and warriors this world will ever see. Depending on their wealth and the kingdom of their birth, the princes of Ulthuan fight in many different ways. Those of Tiranoc typically do battle from the back of swift-wheeled chariots, while the lords of Lothern often stand, spear and bow in hand, amidst the ranks of the Sea Guard. Those with the greatest wealth might ride upon a Great Eagle or Griffon or, in the case of the mightiest princes of Caledor, upon a Dragon. Such steeds are invariably a symbol of status, as well as lending a brutal advantage in the midst of battle.</Description>

				<Description>High Elf Mages are aspirants to the Magical arts, but due to their natural affinity to the Winds of Magic, they are far more powerful then even the most experience Imperial Battle Wizard. By lineage and inclination, the Elves are a magical race. They are fascinated by the secrets of sorcery, and their mages' nimble minds can embrace a deeper understanding of its subtleties and whims than other wizards. It is well that this is so, for without the magics of the High Elf Mages, Ulthuan would have long since have slipped beneath the waves or been overwhelmed by the black sorceries of Naggarothi sorcerers.</Description>

In both matters of martial and spiritual, the Phoenix Guard take their lead from their Anointed of Asuryan. These learned sages were once Phoenix Guards themselves, but over the centuries have chosen to immerse themselves in Asuryan's teachings. Much of their existence is spent within the Chamber of Days, learning the lessons of past and future.</Description>

There, in perhaps the worst display of arrogance in his life, Caradryan stole into the holy Chamber of Days. What he witnessed there, no-one knows, but when he emerged he was a changed man. On his forehead was the glowing rune of Asuryan, marking him as the servant of the Creator God. On that day, Caradryan gave up all his worldly possessions and took the vow of the Phoenix Guard. He has not uttered a word ever since.</Description>

As a result of Phoenix King Morvael's introduction of the levy system, over a thousand years ago the majority of Ulthuan's armies are composed of citizen militia. This system made it so all Elves receive military training, whether it be a craftsman, tradesman or artist, they all must fight in defense of Ulthuan in times of war.</Description>

These dangerous duties require the Sea Guard to maintain a flexible armoury. The vast majority are well-trained in the use of spear, shield and bow — the better to combine the finest aspects of the spear and archer regiments of other cities and realms. Indeed, it is a point of pride in Lothern that the discipline of their warriors far surpasses that of any found elsewhere in Ulthuan.</Description>

Dragon Princes are too distant and aloof, Ellyrian Reavers perhaps a touch too wild and uncivilized; Silver Helms are proud without being haughty, and brave without being undisciplined. Thus, Ulthuan's legends more often center around the deeds of its Silver Helms than any other warriors within the ten realms.</Description>

				<Description>The White Lions have served as the personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First. Whilst hunting in Chrace, Caledor received news that he was to be next Phoenix King. He immediately took the road to the Shrine of Asuryan, but was intercepted by Dark Elf Assassins. He would surely have died, but for the intervention of a party of Chracian woodsmen who swept out of the forest to defend him. The Chracians slew the Dark Elves and, thereafter, saw Caledor safely to the Phoenix Shrine, employing every iota of their woodcraft to avoid further Dark Elf ambushes that lay in their path. Caledor's first act, once crowned as Phoenix King, was to form the Chracians into an official bodyguard based in Lothern.</Description>

When Ulthuan marches to war, none go more eagerly than the Swordmasters of Hoeth, for only in war can they truly unleash the full extent of their deadly art. As the Swordmasters advance, their blades blur and weave, knocking aside arrows in mid-flight and leaving trails of bloody spray wherever Hoeth-forged steel tastes flesh.</Description>

				<Description>The Shadow Warriors are an elite band of scouts, warriors and assassins, who are the descendants of loyalist Elves from the Kingdom of Nagarythe during the time of the great Sundering. The Shadow Warriors are masters of ambush and guerrilla warfare, elite warriors even among other Elves. They strike swiftly and noiselessly from concealment with deadly accurate volleys from their longbows, before charging forth to slay any survivors with a flurry of blades. At some point, every race has felt the wrath of the Shadow Warrior, for they go before the armies of the Asur wherever they fight, slaughtering the enemy's scouts and clearing a path for the main force.</Description>

				<Description>The Phoenix Guard are the guardians of the Shrine of Asuryan, the great pyramid temple in the Sea of Dreams. Deep within lies the Chamber of Days. On its ancient walls, it is said, are the histories of past, present and future, etched in words of fire. Legend tells that any who behold the wall shall forever be cursed with knowledge of their own death. The Phoenix Guard do not utter a word. It is forbidden for those who have seen the secrets of time to speak of them, and all who do so take a magical vow of silence from which they can never be released.</Description>

				<Description>The Dragon Princes of Caledor are amongst the greatest and most noble Knights the world has ever known. Long ago, Ulthuan was dominated by the valorous deeds and wise rule of Caledor's Dragon Princes. Now, the royal bloodline has faded, and the power of the Dragons has diminished, but Caledor's pride still shines bright. The princes of Caledor once rode Dragons, but today they ride to war upon swift horses. Both mount and rider wear crested ithilmar armour whose style echoes that of the heart of Vaul's Anvil, where ancient enchantments are bound into the cooling ithilmar, ensuring that no lesser flame than the fires of Vaul can offer harm to the armour or its wearer.</Description>
