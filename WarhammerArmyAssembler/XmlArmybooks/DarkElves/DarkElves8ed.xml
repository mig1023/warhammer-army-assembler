		<Annotation>The Dark Elves, or the Druchii as they call themselves in their own tongue, also known as the Naggarothi or the "Dark Ones", are one of the most ancient, powerful, and certainly the most sadistic of the three Elven civilisations of the world.\n\nIn the bleak, chilly lands of the continent of Naggaroth in the New World lies the Dark Elven kingdoms of the Witch King Malekith, a realm born from the depths of malice and hate, a kingdom that seeks nothing more than to despoil a world its people believe loathes their existence. With malevolent eyes, the Dark Elves watch this dying world, knowing it is their birthright to rule all that they survey and those that live upon it are born to do nothing more than to grovel at their feet.\n\nThe Druchii are raiders, slavers and heartless reavers of the first degree, their every whim being nothing more than to sow misery and pain to all that oppose them, for misery and pain is the very lifeblood of their existence. Thus do their Black Arks and Corsair Fleets ply the great waters of the world, raiding and enslaving all before them as a tribute to their own avaricious desires.</Annotation>

						<Rule>A unit of Doomfire Warlocks is considered to be a Level 2 Wizard that knows the spells Soulblight (Lore of Death) and Doombolt (Lore of Dark Magic). This doesn't stop other Wizards from knowing those same spells. The unit receives an additional +1 to cast for each rank of 5 or more models in the unit, after the first, to a maximum of +3. Each time the unit casts a spell, you must nominate one Master of Warlocks or Doomfire Warlock as the caster for the purposes of line of sight, range, etc. In the event that a Doomfire Warlock unit rolls a miscast, do not roll on the Miscast table. Instead, the unit suffers D3 Wounds with no armour saves allowed. If the unit is targeted by a rule that affects a Wizard, your opponent must choose one Master of Warlocks or Doomfire Warlock as the target</Rule>
