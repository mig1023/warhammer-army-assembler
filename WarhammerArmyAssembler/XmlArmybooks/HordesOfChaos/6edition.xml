			<Description>The Warriors of Chaos, also known as the Hordes of Chaos, the Followers of Chaos, Chaos Undivided, the Northern Barbarians or simply just the Northmen, are the names given to a race of savage, warlike tribes of Human Barbarians that occupy the harsh and unforgiving lands of the uppermost North, known in the lands of the Old World as the dreaded Northern Waste.\n\nTo all those that face them, the northern barbarians are considered by all to be the enemies of all the world, whose unwavering worship to an uncaring and sadistic pantheon of ancient and evil gods has given them a single driving motive to usher in the inevitable downfall of all mortal-kind into their hellish enslavement.\n\nOut of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice</Description>

				<Weapon>
					<Name>Chaos Daemon Sword</Name>
					<Points>85</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Rule>The wielder has WS, S, I and A as the Greater Daemon of their patron god. With a Mark of Chaos only (except the Mark of Chaos Undivided)</Rule>
					<Lore>This most deadly of all blades contains a bound daemon trapped inside. Although powerful, the Daemon Sword is fickle and treacherous and, if not guarded against, will betray its wielder</Lore>
					<Description>A character with a Daemon Sword has the same WS, S, I and A as the Greater Daemon of their patron god (eg, a Champion of Khorne would have Weapon Skill 10, Strength 7, Initiative 10 and Attacks 7). However, every roll of a 1 to hit in close combat means that the attack is resolved against the character instead of the enemy. Furthermore, the character can never re-roll an unmodified 1 to hit in close combat, regardless of the source of the re-roll</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Sword of Change</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Rule>Roll a D6 every time an enemy character or monster is slain by the Sword of Change. On a 4+ the model is turned into a Chaos Spawn (with only D3 Wounds) controlled by the Chaos player</Rule>
					<Lore>The Sword of Change was wrought within the magical balestorm of the northern Chaos Gate. It was fashioned by the Daemon Warlord Amon 'Chakai, whose fossilised eye is still grasped in the weapon's pommel. The Sword of Change is saturated with the mutating power of Chaos. Even the air around the blade is in flux: at one moment, the blade is wreathed with the scent of sweet perfumes reminiscent of Slaanesh, only to be replaced a heartbeat later with the stench of rot and decay of Nurgle. An eye-blink later and the air around the Sword of Change shines with multicoloured hues of Tzeentch before being surrounded in a haze of misted blood associated with Khorne. This magical sword has the power to reduce those whose flesh it pierces into mindless, flailing mounds of flesh, warping their bodies into monstrosities known as Chaos Spawn</Lore>
					<Description>Roll a D6 every time an enemy character or monster is slain by the Sword of Change. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 nothing happens. On a roll of 4 or more, the model is turned into a Chaos Spawn controlled by the Chaos player! Replace the model with a Chaos Spawn model. If you do not have a spare Chaos Spawn model the model is slain, but the sword has no additional effect. If the enemy is in a unit, dien the Spawn model is placed in contact with the unit on one of its free sides (bearer's choice) and will fight as normal in subsequent combat rounds. The Chaos Spawn starts with only D3 Wounds</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Hellfire sword</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<MultiWounds Val="D6"/>
					<NoArmour/>
					<Rule>Flaming attacks</Rule>
					<Lore>The blade known as the Hellfire Sword was made from a single, searing flame that was hammered into material form and quenched in the blood of a fire-djinn. Those struck by it are set ablaze and may explode as their blood turns to liquid fire. The Hellfire Sword was first wielded by the Chaos Lord Garathor but, over time, it consumed his lifeforce until nought remained within his armour but ash. When the Hellfire Sword was prised from Garathor's ruined gauntlet years later, it flared so hotly that it fused into its new owner’s hand. Eventually, this fool’s spirit was also consumed, and the cycle began anew. Since its creation, a hundred mortals have borne this flame-wreathed blade, unaware of their doom until it was too late</Lore>
					<Description>Flaming attacks, D6 additional wounds with no armour saves</Description>
				</Weapon>

					<Name>Chaos Runesword</Name>
					<Points>70</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<AddToWeaponSkill Val="1"/>
					<AddToStrength Val="1"/>
					<AddToAttacks Val="1"/>
					<Lore>This evil sword was forged by the deluded Dwarf Runesmith Grugni Ironheart, a secret and embittered worshipper of the Chaos gods.[1a] The Witch Hunter Victor Saltzpyre believes there are seven in existence</Lore>
					<Description>The wielder gains +1 Weapon Skill, +1 Strength and +1 Attack</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Whip of Pleasure</Name>
					<Points>50</Points>
					<HitFirst/>
					<AddToAttacks Val="1"/>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Dependencies>
						<On>Mark of Slaanesh</On>
					</Dependencies>
					<Lore>This long whip writhes with its own power, its crack sounding out like a peal of thunder. The Whip of Pleasure lashes out ahead of the wielder to strike the enemy at a distance, rasping flesh from bone</Lore>
					<Description>The wielder gains +1 Attack, but he cannot carry a shield or banner. In addition, the wielder always strikes first in close combat. If any of the wielder's opponents also always strike first, revert to normal Initiative</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Berserker sword</Name>
					<Points>40</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Rule>Half the Unit Strength of all enemy models in base contact as additional Attacks</Rule>
					<Lore>The >Berserker sword fills all who carry it with an uniquenchable battle fury</Lore>
					<Description>The wielder of the Berserker Sword may make additional attacks in every Close Combat phase. The number of additional attacks is equal to half the Unit Strength of all enemy models in base contact (rounding up). For example, a character in contact with two Ogres (combined Unit Strength of 6) would get 3 additional Attacks. If the bearer is involved in a challenge, only the Unit Strength of the opponent is counted</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Rending sword</Name>
					<Points>40</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<MultiWounds Val="D3"/>
					<Rule>Wounded model loses not one but D3 wounds</Rule>
					<Lore>This sword has a series of gnarled teeth instead of an edged blade. When it’s swung, the sword growls and snarls like a beast hungry for flesh. The Rending Sword is a hungry sword. If it isn’t fed at least once per day, the sword sprouts a pair of arms and legs and runs off to feast on its own, usually the companions of the wielder</Lore>
					<Description>A model wounded by the Rending Sword (after saves, etc) loses not one but D3 wounds</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Blade of Blood</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Rule>For each unsaved wound which the Blade of Blood causes, the wielder gains +1 Wound by Strength test</Rule>
					<Lore>The weighty Blade of Blood trembles with a portion of Khorne's boundless rage; its strike crushes not only flesh and armour, but the victim's very soul as well</Lore>
					<Description>For each unsaved wound which the Blade of Blood causes, the wielder may take a Strength test. If the test is passed, the wielder gains +1 Wound. This may not increase his Wounds value above double its normal number of Wounds. If the test is tailed, the wielder loses one Wound</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Filth Mace</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Terror/>
					<PoisonAttack/>
					<Lore>The rusted Filth Mace drips with Nurgle’s choicest plagues and bears an enchantment that ensnares the souls of those crushed beneath its filth-encrusted mass. The screams of these spirits are deafening and fearsome in equal measure, but they are as nothing compared to the terror caused when a fresh soul is bound to the mace, fuelling an epidemic growth of new disease: the wails turn into phlegm-choked laughter and the steady drip of pestilence becomes a weeping flood</Lore>
					<Description>All attacks with the Filth Mace count as poisoned attacks. In addition, if the bearer of the mace kills an enemy character in close combat, he will cause terror for the rest of the game</Description>
				</Weapon>
				<Weapon>
					<Name>Soul Cleaver</Name>
					<Points>35</Points>
					<Only>Mortal</Only>
					<Test Bet="Wound" Context="Wound" Profile="Toughness"/>
					<Lore>This blade was forged over a fire of starving souls. Its edges are worked into a thousand tiny mouths, each studded with spiny teeth and rasping tongues. When it strikes a victim, its vitality is drained away by the Soul Cleaver's dark magic</Lore>
					<Description>Any model wounded by the Soul Cleaver (after saves, etc) must pass a Toughness test or suffer an additional wound (with no saves allowed)</Description>

					<Lore>The Gorelords of the First Circle are Bloodthirsters of the highest rank, given the honour of leading the Lord of Skulls' great hosts. Each Gorelord bears an axe that is part Daemon, part battle-notched iron, known as an Axe of Khorne. This weapon is little less blood-hungry than its wielder, and ever spurs its owner to fresh slaughter</Lore>

					<Lore>The Spelleater Shield is made from daemonhide and adorned with symbols of power. When spells are cast against the bearer, it drains away their power</Lore>
					<Description>The Spelleater Shield is treated like a normal shield. In addition, it grants Magic Resistance (2) to the character and any unit he is with.

				<Description>Chaos Marauders are the standard warriors drawn from the barbaric tribes of the Northmen who hail from the harsh lands of the north, including Norsca, the Chaos Wastes and the Endless Steppes. Chaos Marauders fight on behalf of the Chaos Gods and their tribe. They fight alongside the Chaos Warriors, eager to earn the attention of the Dark Gods and join the esteemed ranks of the Chaos Warriors. These warriors are barbaric to the extreme, wearing almost nothing but fur garments, wielding crude war-axes and bearing wrought metal shields. Nevertheless, these Marauders are rightfully feared for their unnatural savagery and brutality in combat.</Description>

Riding on fast steeds, these warriors range ahead of the main columns of a mortal Chaos army, galloping around the enemy battle line and cutting off any chance of escape. Expert hunters and trackers, Marauder Horsemen are as swift as the wind and merciless as an ice storm.</Description>

				<Description>Chaos Furies are yowling shards of malevolent magical energy - Chaos in its purest form. With little in the way of intelligence, Furies are utterly subservient to the whims of the Dark Gods, and shift in aspect and power as the balance of the dark pantheon alters in the Realm of Chaos. They are easily subjugated by other Daemons, whom they regard with a mix of dread and awe. Furies swarm at the edges of the battle, avoiding the thickest fighting if they can.</Description>

				<Description>A Chaos Spawn is the term used to describe a whole spectrum of mutant creatures warped into being by the corrupting influence of magic and Chaos corruption. Most were once mortal servants of Chaos whose physical bodies collapsed under the strain of receiving more mutational "gifts" from the Dark Gods than their bodies could withstand. Once the last, unbearable mutation takes hold, transforming the creature-that-was into a maddened Chaos Spawn, they now face the inevitable dissolution of their mind and will, becoming something less than yet more than mortal.</Description>
