			<Description>The Lizardmen, sometimes known as the Cold Ones or the Children of the Gods, are an ancient, savage, intelligent race of cold-blooded, reptilian humanoids that were at one time the first and oldest civilisation of the Warhammer World. Long before the rise of Men, Elf or Dwarf, the empire of the Lizardmen ruled supreme.\n\nAlien, enigmatic, and without mercy, the Lizardmen were there when it all began and will be there when the world draws its last dying breath, never tiring nor relenting until order is finally restored to this uncaring, chaotic world. Such is what they were made to do, for they are the ancient servants of the Old Ones, the one true protectors of this very world</Description>

				<Description>Kroq-Gar, known as the Last Defender of Xhotl is an ancient Saurus Oldblood, the last of the remaining Saurus warriors from the now ruined temple-city of Xhotl. The spawning that brought Kroq-Gar into the world produced a handful of other Saurus, each marked for greatness. In the instinctive ways of battle-cunning these warriors were unsurpassed by any of their kind, and each possessed an innate dominion over the native beasts of the jungle.</Description>

				<Description>On occasion, a Skink spawning will not produce an entire cohort from the pools of life, as is the norm, but instead only a single Skink will issue forth. These individuals are marked by the Old Ones and destined to lead, or otherwise achieve greatness amongst their kind. Those Skinks attuned to the energies of the world and that show an aptitude for magic are the Skink Priests, the most intelligent of their kind. Their role is to become the personal attendants of the mighty Slann Mage-Priests, and act as the prophets of the Lizardmen.</Description>

				<Description>Skinks take up weapons during their many patrols as well as to join the fighting during times of war. As troops, they range between reckless audacity and sudden panic. Their skittish nature makes them much more prone to fleeing than the stoic Saurus. They are typically used in two different types of formation. Most commonly, the Skinks advance before the bulk of the main army, harassing the foe’s advance with hails of darts.</Description>

What crawls, creeps and slithers forth is mind-boggling for warmbloods to behold — a living carpet of creatures that moves in a writhing mass. In battle, they wash around the legs of a foe in a wave, hissing, spitting and plunging sharp fangs into unprotected flesh. The smallest of their kind can slip between even the slightest crack or armoured joint to deliver a mortal sting.</Description>

They are hunched bipedal beasts with muscular legs, but when Cold Ones move at speed, they often use their forelimbs for balance and to achieve a more rapid pace. These shortened arms come into their own, however, at the conclusion of a hunt.</Description>

Salamanders are voracious hunters, and their favoured method of catching prey is to swiftly close the distance, moving through underbrush or even submerged under water.</Description>
