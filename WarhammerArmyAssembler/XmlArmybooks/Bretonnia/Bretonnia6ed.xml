		<Description>The Kingdom of Bretonnia, also known as the Land of Chivalry, is a highly martial feudal kingdom that lies between the lands of the Grey Mountains and the Great Ocean. Bretonnia is second only in size to that of the Empire, both their chief rival and closest ally, having a culture and society that revolves around the ideals of nobility, social birthright, and the upholding of a strictly enforced code of chivalry.||Ruled by a Royarch, the nation of Bretonnia has been known throughout the kingdoms of man for having the greatest Knights in the entire Old World, even surpassing that of the Knightly Orders of the Empire. A proud and honourable kingdom, the armies of Bretonnia are comprised mostly of knights and noblemen, who ride into battle with lance, horse, and sword, seeking glory and rooting out injustice wherever they go. The Knights of Bretonnia are trained to fight from childhood, and even the lowliest Knights Errant are considered superior to ordinary warriors. Their skills are further enhanced through constant training, battles and tournaments. It is not only Bretonnia's knights who are famed, however, for the kingdom also boasts the finest human sailors in the World. With their great sails billowing in the wind, Bretonnia's mighty fleets are a majestic sight on the high seas. Due to this regime, the combined military might of Bretonnia has surpassed that of even the greatest armies in history.</Description>
