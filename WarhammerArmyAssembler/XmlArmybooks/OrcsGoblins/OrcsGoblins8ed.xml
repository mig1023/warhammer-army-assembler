		<Annotation>The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of bestial humanoid barbarians and raiders that occupy much of the Eastern Hemisphere of the Warhammer World. The term "Greenskins" is a common collective description used by many civilised nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races. The broadest division is between the Orcs, who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.\n\nThe Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilisation. These tribal warriors are extremely violent, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known world. Time and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, an ever increasing mass of warfare that has the potential to dominate and cover the entire world in a seething green tide.</Annotation>

This dice does not count as a power dice, and cannot contribute to Irresistible Force. However, if you roll a i on this dice you must roll a further D6. On a roll of 4+ nothing else happens, but on a roll of 1-3 the mushroom was poisonous, and the Shaman suffers a wound with no armour saves allowed.

						<Rule>A Great Cave Squig that is used as a mount for a character may re-roll the Random Movement roll as long as the character is still alive. If the character joins a unit of Squig Hoppers then you may re-roll the Random Movement roll for the whole unit</Rule>
						<Rule>Great Cave Squigs are among the most obnoxious, bad-tempered beasts in the Warhammer world, and any Goblins that ride them are considered a 'bad sort' even by gobbo standards. The only unit a Night Goblin character mounted on a Great Cave Squig is allowed to join is a Squig Hopper unit. He is allowed to do this even though characters are not normally allowed to join Squig Hopper units</Rule>

						<Rule>Before moving a Pump Wagon you may declare that the crew are 'pumping harder'. If you do so, you must roll 3D6 for its random movement</Rule>
						<Rule>The exhilaration of batde can cause Snodings to lose control. Any time a Pump Wagon rolls two or more Is for its movement, it will not move as normal but instead veers out of control. Re-roll the Random Movement distance (including the extra dice if you were 'pumping harder'), but this time the Pump Wagon will move in a random direction. If the re-rolled movement also includes two or more Is, then the Pump Wagon has crashed — remove it as a casualty. Otherwise, all Random Movement rules apply, except that a Pump Wagon halted by a friendly unit will inflict 2D6 Impact Hits on die unit that blocks its move</Rule>
						<Rule>Each Snotling base can make a single shooting attack in its Shooting phases, and as a stand and shoot reaction. An Explodin' Spore is a throwing weapon, hitting automatically with no armour saves allowed</Rule>

						<Rule>Their ability to climb walls and squeeze through tight holes makes Giant Spiders ideal at assaulting buildings. Unlike other cavalry, Spider Riders do not have to dismount before assaulting a building, meaning the Giant Spiders are allowed to attack during the assault, and the riders increase their armour save for being mounted. Each Spider Rider and his mount count as a single model when determining the number of models that fight in a building assault. Note that Spider Riders still cannot garrison a building</Rule>

						<Rule>If the Mangier Squigs' move would bring them into contact with another unit, then they move through rather than stopping. If the Mangier Squigs' move would end within a unit, then they automatically bounce through the it - place the Mangier Squigs 1" beyond the unit, in the direction in which they were moving. When Mangier Squigs move through a unit (friend or foe) they inflict 2D6 Strength 6 Armour Piercing hits</Rule>
						<Rule>Mangier Squigs that make a Ker-Splat! attack go wild, their Night Goblin crew being either pulped to death or too busy holding on to even attempt to control the Squigs' direction. Once Mangier Squigs have Gone Crazy they will move in a random direction when they move in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase</Rule>
						<Rule>Mangier Squigs cannot be charged, but models can move into contact with them. Any unit that moves into contact with Mangier Squigs takes 2D6 Strength 6 hits for moving into the Squigs and a further D6 Strength 6 hits due to the Mangier Squigs' death throes (all hits are Armour Piercing). The Mangier Squig model is then removed, and the unit may carry on with its move. Additionally, Mangier Squigs targeted with shooting attacks count as being in soft cover to represent the difficulty of shooting at such an erratic target</Rule>
						<Rule>Not surprisingly, the haphazard Mangier Squigs are prone to a number of spectacularly bloody accidents, such as choking themselves with their own chains, or pummelling each other repeatedly until both Great Cave Squigs are literally mashed to a pulp. Mangier Squigs are removed as a casualty when: they contact other Mangier Squigs (both Mangier Squigs are removed as casualties); they have gone crazy and rolled a triple for movement. This represents the Great Squigs ripping themselves to pieces or some other comic, yet fatal mishap; any unit moves into contact with the Mangier Squigs - see the Force of Total Destruction rule, above</Rule>
