		<Description>The Daemons of Chaos, known also as the Legions of Chaos, the Arch-Enemy, the Great Beast, or simply just Daemons (not to be confused with other kinds of daemons) are malevolent, otherwordly entities born from the deepest and darkest emotions of all mortal creatures. From their fortresses and palaces within this Realm of Chaos, these entities watch with envious eyes towards the mortal kingdoms, waiting with unblinking patience for their chance to wreak destruction and dismay upon the world and to feed upon the misery that they have wrought.\n\nOf the many forces which permeate the world, both emotional and natural otherwise, there are but only Four which holds supreme power within this plane of unnatural existence. Power/Anger, Lust/Pleasure, Death/Despair and Change/Hope are the four greatest forces which have enthralled the world in its grip, for in a world engulfed in such amounts of war, corruption and disease, their dark presence and their malign influence is all but inevitable, for these dark emotions and thoughts fuel the main four Gods of Chaos, Khorne the Blood God, Slaanesh the Dark Prince, Nurgle the Plaguefather and Tzeentch the Changer of Ways</Description>

					<Name>The Portalglyph</Name>
					<Points>75</Points>
					<Rule>Can choose to keep a single unit in the Realm of Chaos instead of deploying it at the start of the game</Rule>
					<Description>If your army contains the Portalglyph, you can choose to keep a single unit in the Realm of Chaos instead of deploying it at the start of the game. The Portalglyph can be placed in any of your Remaining Moves sub-phases. If the bearer is slain, he must immediately place the Portalglyph before being removed as a casualty. In either case, place a counter or other suitable marker within 12" of the bearer and scatter it 3D6" (6D6" if he was slain). If the counter ends up off the board, or within 1" of a unit or impassable terrain, alter the scatter distance by the smallest amount possible to ensure the counter is placed 1" before or beyond the obstruction.\n\nOnce the Portalglyph has been placed, the unit in the Realm of Chaos can enter play through the Portalglyph during the Remaining Moves sub-phase of any subsequent friendly turn. When the unit does so, place it facing any direction, provided that: the unit has at least as many files as it has ranks, the rear of the back rank is in base contact with the counter, no model is more than 12" from the counter, and the unit is not within 1" of another unit, impassable terrain or the board edge. The unit can then move normally (but not march)</Description>

					<Rule>One use only: at the end of any Movement phase place a cursed bulwark (an obstacle up to 8" long) anywhere within 6" of the bearer, at the end of each of your turns, roll a D6: on a score of 1-3 nothing happens; on a score of 4-5 place a further cursed bulwark; on a score of 6 place a cursed tower</Rule>
					<Description>One use only. The bearer of the Rock of Inevitability can use it at the end of any Movement phase. Place a cursed bulwark (an obstacle up to 8" long) anywhere within 6" of the bearer. It cannot be placed on top of (or within 1" of) a unit, or placed on a terrain feature other than a hill. At the end of each of your turns, roll a D6. On a score of 1-3 nothing happens. On a score of 4-5 place a further cursed bulwark. On a score of 6 place a cursed tower (a Citadel Watchtower or another building of similar size). Cursed terrain features placed in this way must be positioned touching an existing cursed terrain feature, and cannot be placed on top of a unit, or a terrain feature other than a hill or forest. If the terrain feature cannot be placed, or you don't have the relevant terrain feature, then nothing is placed. Cursed bulwarks are walls, and cursed towers are buildings. A model from the Forces of Order that is in base contact with either a cursed tower or cursed bulwark suffers a -2 penalty to Initiative</Description>
