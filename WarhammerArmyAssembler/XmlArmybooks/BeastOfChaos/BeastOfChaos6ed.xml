			<Description>The Beastmen, sometimes known as the Beastkin, the Cloven Ones, the Horned Ones, the Beast of Chaos or even the Children of Chaos, are a race of savage mutant humanoids that bear various traits of bestial appearance, such as cloven hooves, muscular human bodies, horned bestial heads and a malign primitive intelligence. Proud of their origins, it is said that they are the descendants of ancient humans corrupted and twisted by the influence of Chaos at the dawn of Chaos's coming into the world.\n\nFrom deep within the twisted forested woodlands of the Old World and beyond, the Beastmen are a violent, war-driven race that seek only to plague and destroy the civilisations of Mankind. They prey on the weak and defenseless, striking at lonely settlements without warning in a rampage of destruction before disappearing into the protective darkness of their dark wilderness, running away from the dire retribution that fails to follow</Description>

				<Description>Khazrak One-Eye - Khazrak has plagued the Drakwald region for several years, descending without warning and then slipping away into the shadows once more. Khazrak has a unique ability to control and harness the unruly spirit of the herd and devise simple but effective battle plans. He is unlike most Beastmen, with a patient and cunning mind at odds with the normal headstrong nature of his kind. Khazrak's warband roams the Drakwald, terrorising the townships and roads, and never before has a Beastman leader proven so elusive to retribution. No one is spared in Khazrak's attacks, his superbly trained Warhounds chasing down the few who manage to escape the warherd itself.</Description>

His, the largest horde of beasts ever seen, ravaged the Empire almost beyond recovery killing millions of Men and bringing two entire provinces to their knees. Gorthor claimed that the Dark Gods had selected him as their emissary. Though he had no true magical powers, he had something of the shaman about him, often being visited by nightmare visions of the future. Such was his fervour in battle that he was sometimes cloaked by coronas of dark energy, which protected him or struck out at his foes, a sure sign to other Beastmen that the gods truly favoured him.</Description>

				<Description>Beast herd - The lowest of the low, even Ungors look down upon Brays for their lack of horns and status among the warherd. They rarely live long, being the very last to get meat and forced to remain the furthest from the warherd's camp fires in winter. Brays take their name from the braying, whinnying, whooping cacophony they make when they band together to eat or kill.</Description>

				<Description>Beast herd - Bestigor are the strongest and meanest of all the brayherd footsoldiers, and are prone to acts of excessive violence. In battle Bestigors form a solid, armoured mass of muscle and iron that charges forward, huge axes levelled, ready to hew the foe limb from limb and trample his broken body beneath their unshod hooves.</Description>

				<Description>Tuskgor Chariot - The chariots of the Beastmen are ramshackle constructions, built from heavy pieces of lumbar scavenged from the ruins of Man's buildings. Drawn by Tuskgors, whose brute strength and ferocity far outmatch that of mere horses, a Beastmen chariot inflicts terrible damage as it charges into the foe.</Description>

				<Description>Warhounds of Chaos - Brutish and bloodthirsty beasts, the Warhounds of Chaos are tireless hunters built of little more than muscle and fang. On the field of battle, the Beastmen release these feral beasts to intercept the forward elements of the enemy army. Packs of Chaos Warhounds will hunt down and pounce upon enemy skirmishers and scouts, bearing them to the ground and ripping them to pieces in their desperate desire to kill.</Description>
